A network architecture that uses one or more end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of storage (rather than stored primarily in cloud data centers), communication (rather than routed over backbone networks), and control, configuration, measurement and management (rather than controlled primarily by network gateways such as those in the LTE core).

#Why?

##Cognitive of End User

 * End to end principal

 * How 5G may look like

## Each Client/Edge Device

 * Powerful (e.g. sensing, storage, computing)

 * Still limited (e.g. battery)

 * Maybe mobile

## Crowds of clients/edges devices are

 * Dense

 * Distributed

 * Under-organized



## Key advantages offered by Fog:

 * Real time processing

 * Rapid, affordable scaling

 * Client-centric objectives

 * Local content and resource pooling

 * Work with encrypted traffic and multi path TCP

## Recent Examples

* Crowd-source network inferences and measurement

* Client-side Het Nets control and configuration

* Client-controlled multi-cloud storage with privacy

* Architectures for consumer wearables

* Edge caching/Home BW management

* Edge analytics/real-time stream-mining

* IoT session management/load

* Client-driven distributed beam-forming

* Clients' idle resource pooling optimization

* Cloudlets/Mobile CDN

* FlashLinQ/LTE Direct/WiFi Direct/AirDrop

* Over The Top (OTT) content management
