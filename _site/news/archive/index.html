Our objective is to enhance the user experience in adaptive HTTP streaming by jointly considering the characteristics of the media content and the available wireless resources in the operator network. Specifically, we propose a proactive QoE-based approach for rewriting the client HTTP requests at a proxy in the mobile network. The advantage of the proposed approach is its applicability for over-the-top (OTT) streaming as it requires no adaptation of the media content. We compare our proposed scheme to both reactive QoE-optimized and to standard-DASH HTTP streaming. Our contributions are: 1) We first show that standard OTT DASH leads to unsatisfactory performance since the content agnostic resource allocation by the LTE scheduler is far from optimal, and we can achieve a clear QoE improvement when considering the content characteristics. 2) We additionally show that proactively rewriting the client requests gives control of the video content adaptation to the network operator which has better information than the client on the load and radio conditions in the cell. This results in additional gains in user perceived video quality. 3) A standard unmodified DASH client remains unaware of the proposed rewriting of the HTTP requests and can decode and play the redirected media segments. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/02/paper6.html" title="Read Quality-of-experience driven adaptive HTTP media delivery"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel6"><span class="iconfont"></span> Flavio Bonomi, et al › <strong>The Smart and Connected Vehicle and the Internet of Things</strong></a> <div id="panel6" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/02/paper5.html" title="Read The Smart and Connected Vehicle and the Internet of Things"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel7"><span class="iconfont"></span> Flavio Bonomi, et al › <strong>The Smart and Connected Vehicle and the Internet of Things</strong></a> <div id="panel7" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/02/paper4.html" title="Read The Smart and Connected Vehicle and the Internet of Things"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel8"><span class="iconfont"></span> Flavio Bonomi, et al › <strong>The Smart and Connected Vehicle and the Internet of Things</strong></a> <div id="panel8" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/02/paper3.html" title="Read The Smart and Connected Vehicle and the Internet of Things"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel9"><span class="iconfont"></span> Hong, Kirak, et al › <strong>Mobile fog: a programming model for large-scale applications on the internet of things</strong></a> <div id="panel9" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/02/paper2.html" title="Read Mobile fog: a programming model for large-scale applications on the internet of things"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel10"><span class="iconfont"></span> Pantelopoulos, Alexandros, and Nikolaos G.

Mainly motivated by increasing healthcare costs and propelled by recent technological advances in miniature biosensing devices, smart textiles, microelectronics, and wireless communications, the continuous advance of wearable sensor-based systems will potentially transform the future of healthcare by enabling proactive personal health management and ubiquitous monitoring of a patient&#39;s health condition. These systems can comprise various types of small physiological sensors, transmission modules and processing capabilities, and can thus facilitate low-cost wearable unobtrusive solutions for continuous all-day and any-place health, mental and activity status monitoring. This paper attempts to comprehensively review the current research and development on wearable biosensor systems for health monitoring. A variety of system implementations are compared in an approach to identify the technological shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art in wearable biosensor solutions. An emphasis is given to multiparameter physiological sensing system designs, providing reliable vital signs measurements and incorporating real-time decision support for early detection of symptoms or context awareness. In order to evaluate the maturity level of the top current achievements in wearable health-monitoring systems, a set of significant features, that best describe the functionality and the characteristics of the systems, has been selected to derive a thorough study. The aim of this survey is not to criticize, but to serve as a reference for researchers and developers in this scientific area and to provide direction for future research improvements <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/02/paper15.html" title="Read A survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel11"><span class="iconfont"></span> Wu, Geng, et al › <strong>M2M: From mobile to embedded internet</strong></a> <div id="panel11" class="content"> Is M2M hype or the future of our information society?

As a result, collections become disorganized and drift out of sync. This paper presents Eyo, a novel personal storage system that provides device transparency: a user can think in terms of “file X”, rather than “file X on device Y ”, and will see the same set of files on all personal devices. Eyo allows a user to view and manage the entire collection of objects from any of their devices, even from disconnected devices and devices with too little storage to hold all the object content. Eyo synchronizes these collections across any network topology, including direct peer-to-peer links. Eyo provides applications with a storage API with first-class access to object version history in order to resolve update conflicts automatically. Experiments with several applications using Eyo— media players, a photo editor, a podcast manager, and an email interface—show that device transparency requires only minor application changes, and matches the storage and bandwidth capabilities of typical portable devices. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper8.html" title="Read Eyo: Device-Transparent Personal Storage"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel19"><span class="iconfont"></span> Miluzzo, Emiliano, Ramón Cáceres, and Yih-Farn Chen › <strong>Vision: mClouds-computing on clouds of mobile devices</strong></a> <div id="panel19" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper7.html" title="Read Vision: mClouds-computing on clouds of mobile devices"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel20"><span class="iconfont"></span> Koukoumidis, Emmanouil, et al › <strong>Pocket cloudlets</strong></a> <div id="panel20" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper6.html" title="Read Pocket cloudlets"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel21"><span class="iconfont"></span> Fernando, Niroshinie, Seng W.

It seamlessly augments users&#39; cognitive abilities via compute-intensive capabilities such as speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. By thus empowering mobile users, we could transform many areas of human activity. This article discusses the technical obstacles to these transformations and proposes a new architecture for overcoming them. In this architecture, a mobile user exploits virtual machine (VM) technology to rapidly instantiate customized service software on a nearby cloudlet and then uses that service over a wireless LAN; the mobile device typically functions as a thin client with respect to the service. A cloudlet is a trusted, resource-rich computer or cluster of computers that&#39;s well-connected to the Internet and available for use by nearby mobile devices. Our strategy of leveraging transiently customized proximate infrastructure as a mobile device moves with its user through the physical world is called cloudlet-based, resource-rich, mobile computing. Crisp interactive response, which is essential for seamless augmentation of human cognition, is easily achieved in this architecture because of the cloudlet&#39;s physical proximity and one-hop network latency. Using a cloudlet also simplifies the challenge of meeting the peak bandwidth demand of multiple users interactively generating and receiving media such as high-definition video and high-resolution images. Rapid customization of infrastructure for diverse applications emerges as a critical requirement, and our results from a proof-of-concept prototype suggest that VM technology can indeed help meet this requirement. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper11.html" title="Read The case for vm-based cloudlets in mobile computing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel29"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ramasubramanian, Venugopalan, et al › <strong>The VMware mobile virtualization platform: is that a hypervisor in your pocket?</strong></a> <div id="panel29" class="content"> Increasingly people manage and share information across a wide variety of computing devices from cell phones to Internet services. Selective replication of content is essential because devices, especially portable ones, have limited resources for storage and communication. Cimbiosys is a novel replication platform that permits each device to define its own content-based filtering criteria and to share updates directly with other devices. In the face of fluid network connectivity, redefinable content filters, and changing content, Cimbiosys ensures two properties not achieved by previous systems. First, every device eventually stores exactly those items whose latest version matches its filter. Second, every device represents its replication-specific metadata in a compact form, with state proportional to the number of devices rather than the number of items. Such compact representation results in low data synchronization overhead, which permits ad hoc replication between newly encountered devices and frequent replication between established partners, even over low bandwidth wireless networks. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper10.html" title="Read The VMware mobile virtualization platform: is that a hypervisor in your pocket?"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel30"><span class="iconfont"></span> Mashtizadeh, Ali José, et al › <strong>Replication, history, and grafting in the Ori file system</strong></a> <div id="panel30" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper1.html" title="Read Replication, history, and grafting in the Ori file system"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel31"><span class="iconfont"></span> Patro, Ashish, Srinivas Govindan, and Suman Banerjee › <strong>Observing home wireless experience through WiFi APs</strong></a> <div id="panel31" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper9.html" title="Read Observing home wireless experience through WiFi APs"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel32"><span class="iconfont"></span> Llorca, Jaime, et al › <strong>Dynamic in-network caching for energy efficient content delivery</strong></a> <div id="panel32" class="content"> Consider a network of prosumers of media content in which users dynamically create and request content objects.

The energy efficient dynamic in-network caching problem aims at finding the evolution of the network configuration, in terms of the content objects being cached and transported over each network element at any given time, that meets user requests, satisfies network resource capacities and minimizes overall energy use.

However, maintaining a highly accurate record of a user&#39;s behavior throughout the day imposes significant energy demands on the phone&#39;s battery. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of METIS: an adaptive mobile sensing platform that efficiently supports social sensing applications. The platform implements a novel sensor task distribution scheme that dynamically decides whether to perform sensing on the phone or in the infrastructure, considering the energy consumption, accuracy, and mobility patterns of the user. By comparing the sensing distribution scheme with sensing performed solely on the phone or exclusively on the fixed remote sensors, we show, through benchmarks using real traces, that the opportunistic sensing distribution achieves over 60% and 40% energy savings, respectively. This is confirmed through a real world deployment in an office environment for over a month: we developed a social application over our frameworks, that is able to infer the collaborations and meetings of the users.

To satisfy the growing demand for stream mining in mobile networks, we propose to employ a cloud-based stream mining system in which the mobile devices send via wireless links unclassified media streams to the cloud for classification. We aim at minimizing the classification-energy cost, defined as an affine combination of classification cost and energy consumption at the cloud, subject to an average stream mining delay constraint (which is important in real-time applications). To address the challenge of time-varying wireless channel conditions without a priori information about the channel statistics, we develop an online algorithm in which the cloud operator can dynamically adjust its resource provisioning on the fly and the mobile devices can adapt their transmission rates to the instantaneous channel conditions. It is proved that, at the expense of increasing the average stream mining delay, the online algorithm achieves a classification-energy cost that can be pushed arbitrarily close to the minimum cost achieved by the optimal offline algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the analysis. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper4.html" title="Read Efficient Resource Provisioning and Rate Selection for Stream Mining in a Community Cloud"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel37"><span class="iconfont"></span> Xu, Jie, et al › <strong>Non-Stationary Resource Allocation Policies for Delay-Constrained Video Streaming: Application to Video over Internet-of-Things-Enabled Networks</strong></a> <div id="panel37" class="content"> Due to the high bandwidth requirements and stringent delay constraints of multi-user wireless video transmission applications, ensuring that all video senders have sufficient transmission opportunities to use before their delay deadlines expire is a longstanding research problem. We propose a novel solution that addresses this problem without assuming detailed packet-level knowledge, which is unavailable at resource allocation time (i.e. prior to the actual compression and transmission). Instead, we translate the transmission delay deadlines of each sender&#39;s video packets into a monotonically-decreasing weight distribution within the considered time horizon. Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability for deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders&#39; video streams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA) approach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the deadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA approach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy that depends on the allocation of previous slots. This is in contrast with all existing slot allocation policies such as round-robin or rate-adaptive round-robin policies, which are stationary because the allocation of the current slot does not depend on the allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal for weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time. We further implement our framework for real-time video streaming in wireless personal area networks that are gaining significant traction within the new Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. For multiple surveillance videos encoded with H.264/AVC and streamed via the 6tisch framework that simulates the IoT-oriented IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH medium access control, our solution is shown to be the only one that ensures all video bitstreams are delivered with acceptable quality in a deadline-- biding manner. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper3.html" title="Read Non-Stationary Resource Allocation Policies for Delay-Constrained Video Streaming: Application to Video over Internet-of-Things-Enabled Networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel38"><span class="iconfont"></span> Li, Qian, et al › <strong>Edge Cloud and Underlay Networks: Empowering 5G Cell-Less Wireless Architecture</strong></a> <div id="panel38" class="content"> The 5th generation wireless communication networks are expected to face the challenge of providing satisfactory - in terms of user experience - connections to ten or even hundred times more connected devices than today.

Indeed, information must frequently be extracted (a) from many distinct data streams, (b) using limited resources, and (c) in real time to be of value. The aim of this chapter is to describe and optimize the specifications of signal processing systems, aimed at extracting in real time valuable information out of large-scale decentralized datasets. A first section will explain the motivations and stakes which have made stream mining a new and emerging field of research and describe key characteristics and challenges of stream mining applications. We then formalize an analytical framework which will be used to describe and optimize distributed stream mining knowledge extraction from large scale streams. In stream mining applications, classifiers are organized into a connected topology mapped onto a distributed infrastructure. We will study linear chains of classifiers and determine how the ordering of the classifiers in the chain impacts accuracy of classification and delay and determine how to choose the most suitable order of classifiers. Finally, we present a decentralized decision framework upon which distributed algorithms for joint topology construction and local classifier configuration can be constructed.

This first deep dive into cellular video streaming shows that HLS, an adaptive bitrate streaming protocol, accounts for one third of the streaming video traffic and that it is common to see changes in encoding bitrates within a session.

Information-Centric Networking and more precisely Content Centric Networking (CCN) overtake the limitation of IP by considering content as the essential element of the network instead of the topology. CCN and its content caching capabilities is particularly adapted to Over-The-Top (OTT) services like YouTube or Netflix that distribute high-definition multimedia content to millions of consumers, independently of their location. However, bringing content as the most important component of the network implies fundamental changes in the Internet and the transition to a fully CCN Internet might take a long time. Despite this transition period where CCN and IP will co-exist, we show that OTT service providers and consumers have strong incentives for migrating to CCN.

In parallel, user expectations for a high quality viewing experience (e.g., low startup delays, low buffering, and high bitrates) are continuously increasing. Unlike traditional workloads that either require low latency (e.g., short web transfers) or high average throughput (e.g., large file transfers), a high quality video viewing experience requires sustained performance over extended periods of time (e.g., tens of minutes). This imposes fundamentally different demands on content delivery infrastructures than those envisioned for traditional traffic patterns. Our large-scale measurements over 200 million video sessions show that today&#39;s delivery infrastructure fails to meet these requirements: more than 20% of sessions have a rebuffering ratio ≥ 10% and more than 14% of sessions have a video startup delay ≥ 10s. Using measurement-driven insights, we make a case for a video control plane that can use a global view of client and network conditions to dynamically optimize the video delivery in order to provide a high quality viewing experience despite an unreliable delivery infrastructure. Our analysis shows that such a control plane can potentially improve the rebuffering ratio by up to 2× in the average case and by more than one order of magnitude under stress. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/29/paper5.html" title="Read A case for a coordinated internet video control plane"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel52"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ibrahim, Ghida, et al › <strong>Toward a new Telco role in future content distribution services</strong></a> <div id="panel52" class="content"> In the recent years the following two trends have been accelerated: on the one hand, as Content Services became at the center of Internet usages, OTTs strengthen their position.

While original OTT services only offered short duration medium quality videos, more recently, premium content such as high definition full feature movies and live video are offered as well. For operators, who see the potential in providing Quality of Experience (QoE) assurance for an increased revenue, this introduces important new network management challenges. Traditional network management paradigms are often not suited for ensuring QoE guarantees as the provider does not have any control on the content’s origin. In this article, we focus on the management of an OTT-based video service. We present a loosely coupled architecture that can be seamlessly integrated into an existing OTT-based video delivery architecture. The framework has the goal of resolving the network bottleneck that might occur from high peaks in the requests for OTT video services. The proposed approach groups the existing Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) based video connections to be multicasted over an access network’s bottleneck and then splits them again to reconstruct the original HTTP connections. A prototype of this architecture is presented, which includes the caching of videos and incorporates retransmission schemes to ensure robust transmission. Furthermore, an autonomic algorithm is presented that allows to intelligently select which OTT videos need to be multicasted by making a remote assessment of the cache state to predict the future availability of content.

Our analysis is conducted on different mobile devices (iOS and Android) over various wireless networks (Wi-Fi, 3G and LTE) under dynamic network conditions. Our measurements show that the video players frequently discard a large amount of video content although it is successfully delivered to a client. We first investigate the root cause of this unwanted behavior. Then, we propose a Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware video streaming architecture in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to reduce the waste of network resource and improve user experience. The architecture includes a selective packet discarding mechanism, which can be placed in packet data network gateways (P-GW). In addition, our QoS-aware rules assist video players in selecting an appropriate resolution under a fluctuating channel condition. We monitor network condition and configure QoS parameters to control availability of the maximum bandwidth in real time. In our experimental setup, the proposed platform shows up to 20.58% improvement in saving downlink bandwidth and improves user experience by reducing buffer underflow period to an average of 32 seconds. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/29/paper1.html" title="Read Towards A Dynamic QoS-aware Over-The-Top Video Streaming in LTE"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel56"><span class="iconfont"></span> Wang, Cong, et al › <strong>Privacy-preserving public auditing for data storage security in cloud computing</strong></a> <div id="panel56" class="content"> Cloud Computing is the long dreamed vision of computing as a utility, where users can remotely store their data into the cloud so as to enjoy the on-demand high quality applications and services from a shared pool of configurable computing resources. By data outsourcing, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed. To securely introduce an effective third party auditor (TPA), the following two fundamental requirements have to be met: 1) TPA should be able to efficiently audit the cloud data storage without demanding the local copy of data, and introduce no additional on-line burden to the cloud user; 2) The third party auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy. In this paper, we utilize and uniquely combine the public key based homomorphic authenticator with random masking to achieve the privacy-preserving public cloud data auditing system, which meets all above requirements. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multi-user setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/28/paper7.html" title="Read Privacy-preserving public auditing for data storage security in cloud computing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel57"><span class="iconfont"></span> Medaglia, Carlo Maria, and Alexandru Serbanati › <strong>An overview of privacy and security issues in the internet of things</strong></a> <div id="panel57" class="content"> While the general definition of the Internet of Things (IoT) is almost mature, roughly defining it as an information network connecting virtual and physical objects, there is a consistent lack of consensus around technical and regulatory solutions.

With these new computing and communications paradigms arise new data security challenges. Existing data protection mechanisms such as encryption have failed in preventing data theft attacks, especially those perpetrated by an insider to the cloud provider. We propose a different approach for securing data in the cloud using offensive decoy technology. We monitor data access in the cloud and detect abnormal data access patterns. When unauthorized access is suspected and then verified using challenge questions, we launch a disinformation attack by returning large amounts of decoy information to the attacker. This protects against the misuse of the user&#39;s real data.

We propose Zerosquare, a privacy-friendly location hub that encourages the development of privacy-preserving geosocial applications. Our primary goal is to store information such that no entity can link a user’s identity to her location. Other goals include decoupling storing data from manipulating data for social networking purposes, designing an architecture flexible enough to support a wide range of use cases, and limiting client-side computation. Zerosquare consists of two separate server components for storing information about users and about locations, respectively, and optional cloud components for supporting applications. We describe the design of the API exposed by the server components and demonstrate how it can be used to build several sample geosocial applications.

However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for sitespecific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee -- a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user&#39;s initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length,(c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of ocalization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence.

This, in turn, calls for scheduling the background communication so as to maximize the throughput. It has been recognized in prior work that a key determinant of throughput is the wireless link quality. However, as we show here, another key factor is the load in the cell, arising from the communication of other nodes. Unlike link quality, the only way, thus far, for a cellular client to obtain a measure of load has been to perform active probing, which defeats the goal of minimizing the active duration of the radio. In this paper, we address the above dilemma by making the following contributions. First, we show experimentally that to obtain good throughput, considering link quality alone is insufficient, and that cellular load must also be factored in. Second, we present a novel technique called LoadSense for a cellular client to obtain a measure of the cellular load, locally and passively, that allows the client to determine the ideal times for communication when available throughput to the client is likely to be high. Finally, we present the Peek-n-Sneak protocol, which enables a cellular client to &#39;peek&#39; into the channel and &#39;sneak&#39; in with its background communication when the conditions are suitable. When multiple clients in a cell perform Peen-n-Sneak, it enables them to coordinate their communications, implicitly and in an entirely distributed manner, akin to CSMA in wireless LANs, helping improve throughput (and reduce energy drain) for all.

Darwin advances mobile phone sensing through the deployment of efficient but sophisticated machine learning techniques specifically designed to run directly on sensor-enabled mobile phones (i.e., smartphones). Darwin tackles three key sensing and inference challenges that are barriers to mass-scale adoption of mobile phone sensing applications: (i) the human-burden of training classifiers, (ii) the ability to perform reliably in different environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor) and (iii) the ability to scale to a large number of phones without jeopardizing the &#39;phone experience&#39; (e.g., usability and battery lifetime). Darwin is a collaborative reasoning framework built on three concepts: classifier/model evolution, model pooling, and collaborative inference.

Given the strong spatial and temporal regularity of human mobility, the needed coverage can typically only be attained through a large participant base. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to attain coverage without scale -- (soft) controlling the movement of participants. We present Crowd Soft Control (CSC), an approach to exert limited control over the temporal and spatial movements of mobile users by leveraging the built-in incentives of location-based gaming and social applications. By pairing network services with these location-based apps, CSC allows researchers to use an application&#39;s incentives (e.g. game objectives) to control the movement of participating users, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the associated network service.

Despite the many related efforts, the inclusion of incentives in crowdsourced systems has so far been mostly ad-hoc, treating incentives as a wild-card response fitted for any occasion and goal. Using data from a large, 2-day experiment with 96 participants at a corporate conference, we present an analysis of the impact of two incentive structures on the recruitment, compliance and user effort of a basic mobile crowdsourced service. We build on these preliminary results to argue for a principled approach for selecting incentive and incentive structures to match the variety of requirements of mobile crowdsourcing applications and discuss key issues in working toward that goal. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper1.html" title="Read No one-size fits all: towards a principled approach for incentives in mobile crowdsourcing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel80"><span class="iconfont"></span> Sundaresan, Srikanth, et al › <strong>Broadband internet performance: a view from the gateway</strong></a> <div id="panel80" class="content"> We present the first study of network access link performance measured directly from home gateway devices. Policymakers, ISPs, and users are increasingly interested in studying the performance of Internet access links. Because of many confounding factors in a home network or on end hosts, however, thoroughly understanding access network performance requires deploying measurement infrastructure in users&#39; homes as gateway devices. In conjunction with the Federal Communication Commission&#39;s study of broadband Internet access in the United States, we study the throughput and latency of network access links using longitudinal measurements from nearly 4,000 gateway devices across 8 ISPs from a deployment of over 4,200 devices. We study the performance users achieve and how various factors ranging from the user&#39;s choice of modem to the ISP&#39;s traffic shaping policies can affect performance. Our study yields many important findings about the characteristics of existing access networks. Our findings also provide insights into the ways that access network performance should be measured and presented to users, which can help inform ongoing broader efforts to benchmark the performance of access networks. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper9.html" title="Read Broadband internet performance: a view from the gateway"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel81"><span class="iconfont"></span> Sharma, Abhigyan, Arun Venkataramani, and Antonio A.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of strategies to control server bandwidth allocation. As part of this effort, we introduce a new model-based control approach that relies on an accurate yet concise “cheat sheet” based on a priori offline measurement to predict swarm performance as a function of the server bandwidth and other swarm parameters. Our evaluation using a prototype system, SwarmServer, instantiating static, dynamic, and model-based controllers shows that static and dynamic controllers can both be suboptimal due to different reasons. In comparison, a model-based approach consistently outperforms both static and dynamic approaches provided it has access to detailed measurements in the regime of interest. Nevertheless, the broad applicability of a model-based approach may be limited in practice because of the overhead of developing and maintaining a comprehensive measurement-based model of swarm performance in each regime of interest. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper8.html" title="Read Pros & cons of model-based bandwidth control for client-assisted content delivery"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel82"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ha, Sangtae, et al › <strong>Tube: time-dependent pricing for mobile data</strong></a> <div id="panel82" class="content"> The two largest U.S. wireless ISPs have recently moved towards usage-based pricing to better manage the growing demand on their networks. Yet usage-based pricing still requires ISPs to over-provision capacity for demand at peak times of the day. Time-dependent pricing (TDP) addresses this problem by considering when a user consumes data, in addition to how much is used. We present the architecture, implementation, and a user trial of an end-to-end TDP system called TUBE. TUBE creates a price-based feedback control loop between an ISP and its end users. On the ISP side, it computes TDP prices so as to balance the cost of congestion during peak periods with that of offering lower prices in less congested periods. On mobile devices, it provides a graphical user interface that allows users to respond to the offered prices either by themselves or using an ;&#39;autopilot&#39; mode. We conducted a pilot TUBE trial with 50 iPhone or iPad 3G data users, who were charged according to our TDP algorithms. Our results show that TDP benefits both operators and customers, flattening the temporal fluctuation of demand while allowing users to save money by choosing the time and volume of their usage. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper7.html" title="Read Tube: time-dependent pricing for mobile data"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel83"><span class="iconfont"></span> Wang, Lusheng, and G-SGS Kuo › <strong>Mathematical modeling for network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks—A tutorial</strong></a> <div id="panel83" class="content"> In heterogeneous wireless networks, an important task for mobile terminals is to select the best network for various communications at any time anywhere, usually called network selection. In recent years, this topic has been widely studied by using various mathematical theories. The employed theory decides the objective of optimization, complexity and performance, so it is a must to understand the potential mathematical theories and choose the appropriate one for obtaining the best result. Therefore, this paper systematically studies the most important mathematical theories used for modeling the network selection problem in the literature. With a carefully designed unified scenario, we compare the schemes of various mathematical theories and discuss the ways to benefit from combining multiple of them together. Furthermore, an integrated scheme using multiple attribute decision making as the core of the selection procedure is proposed. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper6.html" title="Read Mathematical modeling for network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks—A tutorial"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel84"><span class="iconfont"></span> Im, Youngbin, et al › <strong>AMUSE: Empowering users for cost-aware offloading with throughput-delay tradeoffs</strong></a> <div id="panel84" class="content"> Mobile users face a tradeoff between cost, throughput, and delay in making their offloading decisions. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose AMUSE (Adaptive bandwidth Management through USer-Empowerment), a practical, costaware WiFi offloading system that takes into account a user&#39;s throughput-delay tradeoffs and cellular budget constraint. Based on predicted future usage and WiFi availability, AMUSE decides which applications to offload to what times of the day. To practically enforce the assigned rate of each TCP application, we introduce a receiver-side TCP bandwidth control algorithm that adjusts the rate by controlling the TCP advertisement window from the user side. We implement AMUSE on Windows 7 tablets and evaluate its effectiveness with 3G and WiFi usage data obtained from a trial with 25 mobile users.

Our solution is centered on smart home gateways that allocate bandwidth in a two-level hierarchy: first, a gateway purchases guaranteed bandwidth from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) with virtual credits. It then self-limits its bandwidth usage and distributes the bandwidth among its apps and devices according to their relative priorities. To this end, we design a credit allocation and redistribution mechanism for the first level, and implement our gateways on commodity wireless routers for the second level. We demonstrate our system&#39;s effectiveness and practicality with theoretical analysis, simulations and experiments on real traffic. Compared to a baseline equal sharing algorithm, our solution significantly improves users&#39; overall satisfaction and yields a fair allocation of bandwidth across users.. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper4.html" title="Read Mind Your Own Bandwidth: An Edge Solution to Peak-hour Broadband Congestion"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel86"><span class="iconfont"></span> Aryafar, Ehsan, et al › <strong>RAT selection games in HetNets</strong></a> <div id="panel86" class="content"> We study the dynamics of network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets). Users in such networks selfishly select the best radio access technology (RAT) with the objective of maximizing their own throughputs. We propose two general classes of throughput models that capture the basic properties of random access (e.g., Wi-Fi) and scheduled access (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, 3G) networks. Next, we formulate the problem as a non-cooperative game, and study its convergence, efficiency, and practicality. Our results reveal that: (i) Singleclass RAT selection games converge to Nash equilibria, while an improvement path can be repeated infinitely with a mixture of classes. We next introduce a hysteresis mechanism in RAT selection games, and prove that with appropriate hysteresis policies, convergence can still be guaranteed; (ii) We analyze the Pareto-efficiency of the Nash equilibria of these games. We derive the conditions under which Nash equilibria are Paretooptimal, and we quantify the distance of Nash equilibria with respect to the set of Pareto-dominant points when the conditions are not satisfied; (iii) Finally, with extensive measurement-driven simulations we show that RAT selection games converge to Nash equilibria in a small number of steps, and hence are amenable to practical implementation. We also investigate the impact of noisy throughput measurements, and propose solutions to handle them. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper3.html" title="Read RAT selection games in HetNets"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel87"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ravindranath, Lenin, et al › <strong>Procrastinator: Pacing Mobile Apps’ Usage of the Network.</strong></a> <div id="panel87" class="content"> Many popular, professionally-written smartphone apps today prefetch large amounts of network data to improve performance. However, the typical user may not use all of this network data. When a user is on a limited or pay-per-byte cellular data plan, such as when roaming internationally, this prefetching behavior can cost her in overage fees on her cellular bill. This video demonstrates Procrastinator, which is a system that automatically decides when to fetch each network object that an app requests. This decision is made based on whether the user is on Wi-Fi or cellular, how many bytes are remaining on her data plan, and whether the object is needed at the present time. Procrastinator does not require app developer effort, nor app source code, nor OS changes -- it modifies the app binary to trap specific system calls and inject custom code. Our system can achieve as little as no savings to 4X reduction in total bytes transferred by an app, depending on the user and the app. These savings for the data-poor user come with a 300ms median latency penalty on LTE if the user goes to a part of the app where Procrastinator did not allow data to be prefetched. This video shows how main content on the primary page of apps is unaffected, and the delay that the user will typically experience if she goes to secondary pages in apps when she is running out of cellular data plan bytes.. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper2.html" title="Read Procrastinator: Pacing Mobile Apps’ Usage of the Network."><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel88"><span class="iconfont"></span> Balakrishnan, Hari, Hariharan S. Rahul, and Srinivasan Seshan › <strong>An integrated congestion management architecture for Internet hosts</strong></a> <div id="panel88" class="content"> This paper presents a novel framework for managing network congestion from an end-to-end perspective. Our work is motivated by trends in traffic patterns that threaten the long-term stability of the Internet. These trends include the use of multiple independent concurrent flows by Web applications and the increasing use of transport protocols and applications that do not adapt to congestion. We present an end-system architecture centered around a Congestion Manager (CM) that ensures proper congestion behavior and allows applications to easily adapt to network congestion. Our framework integrates congestion management across all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains congestion parameters and exposes an API to enable applications to learn about network characteristics, pass information to the CM, and schedule data transmissions. Internally, it uses a window-based control algorithm, a scheduler to regulate transmissions, and a lightweight protocol to elicit feedback from receivers.We describe how TCP and an adaptive real-time streaming audio application can be implemented using the CM. Our simulation results show that an ensemble of concurrent TCP connections can effectively share bandwidth and obtain consistent performance, without adversely affecting other network flows. Our results also show that the CM enables audio applications to adapt to congestion conditions without having to perform congestion control or bandwidth probing on their own. We conclude that the CM provides a useful and pragmatic framework for building adaptive Internet applications. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper12.html" title="Read An integrated congestion management architecture for Internet hosts"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel89"><span class="iconfont"></span> Misra, Vishal, et al › <strong>Incentivizing peer-assisted services: a fluid shapley value approach</strong></a> <div id="panel89" class="content"> A new generation of content delivery networks for live streaming, video on demand, and software updates takes advantage of a peer-to-peer architecture to reduce their operating cost. In contrast with previous uncoordinated peer-to-peer schemes, users opt-in to dedicate part of the resources they own to help the content delivery, in exchange for receiving the same service at a reduced price. Such incentive mechanisms are appealing, as they simplify coordination and accounting. However, they also increase a user&#39;s expectation that she will receive a fair price for the resources she provides. Addressing this issue carefully is critical in ensuring that all interested parties--including the provider--are willing to participate in such a system, thereby guaranteeing its stability. In this paper, we take a cooperative game theory approach to identify the ideal incentive structure that follows the axioms formulated by Lloyd Shapley. This ensures that each player, be it the provider or a peer, receives an amount proportional to its contribution and bargaining power when entering the game. In general, the drawback of this ideal incentive structure is its computational complexity. However, we prove that as the number of peers receiving the service becomes large, the Shapley value received by each player approaches a fluid limit. This limit follows a simple closed form expression and can be computed in several scenarios of interest: by applying our technique, we show that several peer-assisted services, deployed on both wired and wireless networks, can benefit from important cost and energy savings with a proper incentive structure that follows simple compensation rules. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper11.html" title="Read Incentivizing peer-assisted services: a fluid shapley value approach"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel90"><span class="iconfont"></span> Yang, Jeonghwa, W. Keith Edwards, and David Haslem › <strong>Eden: supporting home network management through interactive visual tools</strong></a> <div id="panel90" class="content"> As networking moves into the home, home users are increasingly being faced with complex network management chores. Previous research, however, has demonstrated the difficulty many users have in managing their networks. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that advanced network management tools - such as those developed for the enterprise - are generally too complex for home users, do not support the common tasks they face, and are not a good fit for the technical peculiarities of the home. This paper presents Eden, an interactive, direct manipulation home network management system aimed at end users. Eden supports a range of common tasks, and provides a simple conceptual model that can help users understand key aspects of networking better. The system leverages a novel home network router that acts as a &#39;dropin&#39; replacement for users&#39; current router. We demonstrate that Eden not only improves the user experience of networking, but also aids users in forming workable conceptual models of how the network works. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper10.html" title="Read Eden: supporting home network management through interactive visual tools"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel91"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ravindranath, Lenin, et al › <strong>Video: Procrastinator: pacing mobile apps' usage of the network</strong></a> <div id="panel91" class="content"> There are two emerging trends in the mobile data world. First, mobile data is exploding at a rapid rate with analysts predicting 25-50X growth by the year 2015. The second trend is that users are demanding greater degree of flexibility in selecting their operators at fine timescales. Across Asia, dual-SIM phones have become popular, while Apple is rumored to be designing a Universal SIM that will allow iPhone users to toggle between different operators. This latter trend points towards an impending disruption in wireless service models which could also be the need of the hour from the spectrum shortage perspective. This points towards a new service model where users can choose an operator based on application needs. However, if users make this choice greedily without network assistance, it can exacerbate spectrum scarcity and degrade user experience. In this work, we consider user devices with multiple network interfaces (3G, LTE etc.) that can be simultaneously active and each running multiple applications. We propose the MOTA service model to enable users to associate each interface with the operator of choice at fine time scales. Under the MOTA service model, through concise signalling information, operators provide information about their own network, so that each user can (i) choose a suitable operator for each interface, and (ii) choose an interface for each active application. We make the following contributions in this paper. First, we propose concise network signalling that assists users to make informed choices even under mobility. Second, we develop user-choice algorithms that maximize a suitable notion of user satisfaction while using spectrum resources efficiently. Third, we perform extensive evaluation over actual base station deployment in a city coupled with real signal propagation maps. Our results with two operators show that, MOTA service model provides capacity gain in the range 2.5-4X over the current existing service model. Finally, we argue that our solution is practically implementable by combining appropriate IEEE standards and IETF proposals. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/client-paper1.html" title="Read Video: Procrastinator: pacing mobile apps' usage of the network"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel92"><span class="iconfont"></span> Education › <strong>First MOOC on FOG</strong></a> <div id="panel92" class="content"> Fog Networks and the Internet of Things <a href="http://localhost:4000/news/2015/03/10/FOGCourse.html" title="Read First MOOC on FOG"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> </dl> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="up-to-top" class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="subfooter"> <nav class="row"> <section id="subfooter-left" class="b30 small-12 medium-6 columns"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li>© 2014 Board of Trustees Princeton University | Designed and developed at the Princeton EDGE Lab with JEKYLL using FEELING RESPONSIVE theme</li> </ul> </section> <section id="subfooter-right" class="small-12 medium-6 columns social-icons"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-twitter" title="Immer das Neuste von Phlow gibt es auf Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-github" title="Code und mehr..."></a></li> </ul> </section> </nav> </div><!-- /#subfooter --> </footer> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/javascript.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
