As a result, collections become disorganized and drift out of sync. This paper presents Eyo, a novel personal storage system that provides device transparency: a user can think in terms of “file X”, rather than “file X on device Y ”, and will see the same set of files on all personal devices. Eyo allows a user to view and manage the entire collection of objects from any of their devices, even from disconnected devices and devices with too little storage to hold all the object content. Eyo synchronizes these collections across any network topology, including direct peer-to-peer links. Eyo provides applications with a storage API with first-class access to object version history in order to resolve update conflicts automatically. Experiments with several applications using Eyo— media players, a photo editor, a podcast manager, and an email interface—show that device transparency requires only minor application changes, and matches the storage and bandwidth capabilities of typical portable devices. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper8.html" title="Read Eyo: Device-Transparent Personal Storage"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel4"><span class="iconfont"></span> Miluzzo, Emiliano, Ramón Cáceres, and Yih-Farn Chen › <strong>Vision: mClouds-computing on clouds of mobile devices</strong></a> <div id="panel4" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper7.html" title="Read Vision: mClouds-computing on clouds of mobile devices"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel5"><span class="iconfont"></span> Koukoumidis, Emmanouil, et al › <strong>Pocket cloudlets</strong></a> <div id="panel5" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper6.html" title="Read Pocket cloudlets"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel6"><span class="iconfont"></span> Fernando, Niroshinie, Seng W.

App developers have to frequently manage the local storage on the device (e.g., SQLite databases, file systems), as well as data synchronization with cloud services. Developers have to address common issues such as data packaging, handling network failures, supporting disconnected operations, propagating changes, and detecting and resolving conflicts. To free mobile developers from this burden, we are building Simba, a platform to rapidly develop and deploy datacentric mobile apps. Simba provides a unified storage and synchronization API for both structured data and unstructured objects.

It seamlessly augments users&#39; cognitive abilities via compute-intensive capabilities such as speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. By thus empowering mobile users, we could transform many areas of human activity. This article discusses the technical obstacles to these transformations and proposes a new architecture for overcoming them. In this architecture, a mobile user exploits virtual machine (VM) technology to rapidly instantiate customized service software on a nearby cloudlet and then uses that service over a wireless LAN; the mobile device typically functions as a thin client with respect to the service. A cloudlet is a trusted, resource-rich computer or cluster of computers that&#39;s well-connected to the Internet and available for use by nearby mobile devices. Our strategy of leveraging transiently customized proximate infrastructure as a mobile device moves with its user through the physical world is called cloudlet-based, resource-rich, mobile computing. Crisp interactive response, which is essential for seamless augmentation of human cognition, is easily achieved in this architecture because of the cloudlet&#39;s physical proximity and one-hop network latency. Using a cloudlet also simplifies the challenge of meeting the peak bandwidth demand of multiple users interactively generating and receiving media such as high-definition video and high-resolution images. Rapid customization of infrastructure for diverse applications emerges as a critical requirement, and our results from a proof-of-concept prototype suggest that VM technology can indeed help meet this requirement. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper11.html" title="Read The case for vm-based cloudlets in mobile computing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel14"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ramasubramanian, Venugopalan, et al › <strong>The VMware mobile virtualization platform: is that a hypervisor in your pocket?</strong></a> <div id="panel14" class="content"> Increasingly people manage and share information across a wide variety of computing devices from cell phones to Internet services. Selective replication of content is essential because devices, especially portable ones, have limited resources for storage and communication. Cimbiosys is a novel replication platform that permits each device to define its own content-based filtering criteria and to share updates directly with other devices. In the face of fluid network connectivity, redefinable content filters, and changing content, Cimbiosys ensures two properties not achieved by previous systems. First, every device eventually stores exactly those items whose latest version matches its filter. Second, every device represents its replication-specific metadata in a compact form, with state proportional to the number of devices rather than the number of items. Such compact representation results in low data synchronization overhead, which permits ad hoc replication between newly encountered devices and frequent replication between established partners, even over low bandwidth wireless networks. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper10.html" title="Read The VMware mobile virtualization platform: is that a hypervisor in your pocket?"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel15"><span class="iconfont"></span> Mashtizadeh, Ali José, et al › <strong>Replication, history, and grafting in the Ori file system</strong></a> <div id="panel15" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/paper1.html" title="Read Replication, history, and grafting in the Ori file system"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel16"><span class="iconfont"></span> Patro, Ashish, Srinivas Govindan, and Suman Banerjee › <strong>Observing home wireless experience through WiFi APs</strong></a> <div id="panel16" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper9.html" title="Read Observing home wireless experience through WiFi APs"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel17"><span class="iconfont"></span> Llorca, Jaime, et al › <strong>Dynamic in-network caching for energy efficient content delivery</strong></a> <div id="panel17" class="content"> Consider a network of prosumers of media content in which users dynamically create and request content objects.

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of METIS: an adaptive mobile sensing platform that efficiently supports social sensing applications. The platform implements a novel sensor task distribution scheme that dynamically decides whether to perform sensing on the phone or in the infrastructure, considering the energy consumption, accuracy, and mobility patterns of the user. By comparing the sensing distribution scheme with sensing performed solely on the phone or exclusively on the fixed remote sensors, we show, through benchmarks using real traces, that the opportunistic sensing distribution achieves over 60% and 40% energy savings, respectively. This is confirmed through a real world deployment in an office environment for over a month: we developed a social application over our frameworks, that is able to infer the collaborations and meetings of the users. In this setting the system preserves over 35% more battery life over pure phone sensing. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper5.html" title="Read METIS: Exploring mobile phone sensing offloading for efficiently supporting social sensing applications"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel21"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ren, Shaolei, and Mihaela van der Schaar › <strong>Efficient Resource Provisioning and Rate Selection for Stream Mining in a Community Cloud</strong></a> <div id="panel21" class="content"> Real-time stream mining such as surveillance and personal health monitoring, which involves sophisticated mathematical operations, is computation-intensive and prohibitive for mobile devices due to the hardware/computation constraints. To satisfy the growing demand for stream mining in mobile networks, we propose to employ a cloud-based stream mining system in which the mobile devices send via wireless links unclassified media streams to the cloud for classification. We aim at minimizing the classification-energy cost, defined as an affine combination of classification cost and energy consumption at the cloud, subject to an average stream mining delay constraint (which is important in real-time applications). To address the challenge of time-varying wireless channel conditions without a priori information about the channel statistics, we develop an online algorithm in which the cloud operator can dynamically adjust its resource provisioning on the fly and the mobile devices can adapt their transmission rates to the instantaneous channel conditions. It is proved that, at the expense of increasing the average stream mining delay, the online algorithm achieves a classification-energy cost that can be pushed arbitrarily close to the minimum cost achieved by the optimal offline algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the analysis. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper4.html" title="Read Efficient Resource Provisioning and Rate Selection for Stream Mining in a Community Cloud"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel22"><span class="iconfont"></span> Xu, Jie, et al › <strong>Non-Stationary Resource Allocation Policies for Delay-Constrained Video Streaming: Application to Video over Internet-of-Things-Enabled Networks</strong></a> <div id="panel22" class="content"> Due to the high bandwidth requirements and stringent delay constraints of multi-user wireless video transmission applications, ensuring that all video senders have sufficient transmission opportunities to use before their delay deadlines expire is a longstanding research problem. We propose a novel solution that addresses this problem without assuming detailed packet-level knowledge, which is unavailable at resource allocation time (i.e. prior to the actual compression and transmission). Instead, we translate the transmission delay deadlines of each sender&#39;s video packets into a monotonically-decreasing weight distribution within the considered time horizon. Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability for deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders&#39; video streams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA) approach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the deadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA approach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy that depends on the allocation of previous slots. This is in contrast with all existing slot allocation policies such as round-robin or rate-adaptive round-robin policies, which are stationary because the allocation of the current slot does not depend on the allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal for weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time. We further implement our framework for real-time video streaming in wireless personal area networks that are gaining significant traction within the new Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. For multiple surveillance videos encoded with H.264/AVC and streamed via the 6tisch framework that simulates the IoT-oriented IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH medium access control, our solution is shown to be the only one that ensures all video bitstreams are delivered with acceptable quality in a deadline-- biding manner. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper3.html" title="Read Non-Stationary Resource Allocation Policies for Delay-Constrained Video Streaming: Application to Video over Internet-of-Things-Enabled Networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel23"><span class="iconfont"></span> Li, Qian, et al › <strong>Edge Cloud and Underlay Networks: Empowering 5G Cell-Less Wireless Architecture</strong></a> <div id="panel23" class="content"> The 5th generation wireless communication networks are expected to face the challenge of providing satisfactory - in terms of user experience - connections to ten or even hundred times more connected devices than today.

Due to the physical separation among data sources and computational resources, it is often necessary to deploy such stream mining systems in a distributed fashion, where local learners have access to disjoint subsets of the data that is to be mined, and forward their intermediate results to an ensemble learner that combines the results from the local learners. In this paper, we develop a design methodology for integrated de- sign, simulation, and implementation of dynamic data-driven adaptive stream mining systems. By systematically integrating considerations associated with local embedded processing, classifier configuration, data-driven adaptation and networked com- munication, our approach allows for effective assessment, prototyping, and implementation of alternative distributed design methods for data-driven, adaptive stream mining systems.

In this paper, we present an NRS called Multi-level Distributed Hash Table (MDHT).

A key application driving that growth is video streaming. Yet very little is known about the characteristics of this traffic class. In this paper, we examine video traffic generated by three million users across one of the world&#39;s largest 3G cellular networks. This first deep dive into cellular video streaming shows that HLS, an adaptive bitrate streaming protocol, accounts for one third of the streaming video traffic and that it is common to see changes in encoding bitrates within a session. We also observe that most of the content is streamed at less than 255 Kbps and that only 40% of the videos are fully downloaded. Another key finding is that there exists significant potential for caching to deliver this content. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/29/paper7.html" title="Read Over the top video: the gorilla in cellular networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel28"><span class="iconfont"></span> Saucez, Damien, Chadi Barakat, and Thierry Turletti › <strong>Leveraging Information Centric Networking in Over-The-Top Services</strong></a> <div id="panel28" class="content"> The ubiquity of broadband Internet and the proliferation of connected devices like laptops, tablets or TV result in a high demand of multimedia content such as high definition video on demand (VOD) for which the Internet has been poorly designed with the Internet Protocol (IP). Information-Centric Networking and more precisely Content Centric Networking (CCN) overtake the limitation of IP by considering content as the essential element of the network instead of the topology. CCN and its content caching capabilities is particularly adapted to Over-The-Top (OTT) services like YouTube or Netflix that distribute high-definition multimedia content to millions of consumers, independently of their location. However, bringing content as the most important component of the network implies fundamental changes in the Internet and the transition to a fully CCN Internet might take a long time. Despite this transition period where CCN and IP will co-exist, we show that OTT service providers and consumers have strong incentives for migrating to CCN. We also propose a transition mechanism that leverages caching and enable loosely collaboration. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/29/paper6.html" title="Read Leveraging Information Centric Networking in Over-The-Top Services"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel29"><span class="iconfont"></span> Liu, Xi, et al › <strong>A case for a coordinated internet video control plane</strong></a> <div id="panel29" class="content"> Video traffic already represents a significant fraction of today&#39;s traffic and is projected to exceed 90% in the next five years. In parallel, user expectations for a high quality viewing experience (e.g., low startup delays, low buffering, and high bitrates) are continuously increasing. Unlike traditional workloads that either require low latency (e.g., short web transfers) or high average throughput (e.g., large file transfers), a high quality video viewing experience requires sustained performance over extended periods of time (e.g., tens of minutes). This imposes fundamentally different demands on content delivery infrastructures than those envisioned for traditional traffic patterns. Our large-scale measurements over 200 million video sessions show that today&#39;s delivery infrastructure fails to meet these requirements: more than 20% of sessions have a rebuffering ratio ≥ 10% and more than 14% of sessions have a video startup delay ≥ 10s. Using measurement-driven insights, we make a case for a video control plane that can use a global view of client and network conditions to dynamically optimize the video delivery in order to provide a high quality viewing experience despite an unreliable delivery infrastructure. Our analysis shows that such a control plane can potentially improve the rebuffering ratio by up to 2× in the average case and by more than one order of magnitude under stress. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/29/paper5.html" title="Read A case for a coordinated internet video control plane"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel30"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ibrahim, Ghida, et al › <strong>Toward a new Telco role in future content distribution services</strong></a> <div id="panel30" class="content"> In the recent years the following two trends have been accelerated: on the one hand, as Content Services became at the center of Internet usages, OTTs strengthen their position.

In particular, it focuses on the “value” that Telcos can bring to CDN providers and Content providers and analyses the required evolutions of the involved systems&#39; architectures (network and content delivery).

While original OTT services only offered short duration medium quality videos, more recently, premium content such as high definition full feature movies and live video are offered as well. For operators, who see the potential in providing Quality of Experience (QoE) assurance for an increased revenue, this introduces important new network management challenges. Traditional network management paradigms are often not suited for ensuring QoE guarantees as the provider does not have any control on the content’s origin. In this article, we focus on the management of an OTT-based video service. We present a loosely coupled architecture that can be seamlessly integrated into an existing OTT-based video delivery architecture. The framework has the goal of resolving the network bottleneck that might occur from high peaks in the requests for OTT video services. The proposed approach groups the existing Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) based video connections to be multicasted over an access network’s bottleneck and then splits them again to reconstruct the original HTTP connections. A prototype of this architecture is presented, which includes the caching of videos and incorporates retransmission schemes to ensure robust transmission. Furthermore, an autonomic algorithm is presented that allows to intelligently select which OTT videos need to be multicasted by making a remote assessment of the cache state to predict the future availability of content. The approach was evaluated through both simulation and large scale emulation and shows a significant gain in scalability of the prototype compared to a traditional video delivery architecture. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/29/paper3.html" title="Read A multicast-enabled delivery framework for QoE assurance of over-the-top services in multimedia access networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel32"><span class="iconfont"></span> Seppanen, J., and Martín Varela › <strong>QoE-driven network management for real-time over-the-top multimedia services</strong></a> <div id="panel32" class="content"> This paper introduces a network access point (AP) control solution in the context of over-the-top (OTT) multimedia services.

Our analysis is conducted on different mobile devices (iOS and Android) over various wireless networks (Wi-Fi, 3G and LTE) under dynamic network conditions. Our measurements show that the video players frequently discard a large amount of video content although it is successfully delivered to a client. We first investigate the root cause of this unwanted behavior. Then, we propose a Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware video streaming architecture in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks to reduce the waste of network resource and improve user experience. The architecture includes a selective packet discarding mechanism, which can be placed in packet data network gateways (P-GW).

By data outsourcing, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed. To securely introduce an effective third party auditor (TPA), the following two fundamental requirements have to be met: 1) TPA should be able to efficiently audit the cloud data storage without demanding the local copy of data, and introduce no additional on-line burden to the cloud user; 2) The third party auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy. In this paper, we utilize and uniquely combine the public key based homomorphic authenticator with random masking to achieve the privacy-preserving public cloud data auditing system, which meets all above requirements. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multi-user setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/28/paper7.html" title="Read Privacy-preserving public auditing for data storage security in cloud computing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel35"><span class="iconfont"></span> Medaglia, Carlo Maria, and Alexandru Serbanati › <strong>An overview of privacy and security issues in the internet of things</strong></a> <div id="panel35" class="content"> While the general definition of the Internet of Things (IoT) is almost mature, roughly defining it as an information network connecting virtual and physical objects, there is a consistent lack of consensus around technical and regulatory solutions.

Our primary goal is to store information such that no entity can link a user’s identity to her location. Other goals include decoupling storing data from manipulating data for social networking purposes, designing an architecture flexible enough to support a wide range of use cases, and limiting client-side computation. Zerosquare consists of two separate server components for storing information about users and about locations, respectively, and optional cloud components for supporting applications.

However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for sitespecific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee -- a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user&#39;s initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length,(c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of ocalization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence.

This, in turn, calls for scheduling the background communication so as to maximize the throughput. It has been recognized in prior work that a key determinant of throughput is the wireless link quality. However, as we show here, another key factor is the load in the cell, arising from the communication of other nodes. Unlike link quality, the only way, thus far, for a cellular client to obtain a measure of load has been to perform active probing, which defeats the goal of minimizing the active duration of the radio. In this paper, we address the above dilemma by making the following contributions. First, we show experimentally that to obtain good throughput, considering link quality alone is insufficient, and that cellular load must also be factored in. Second, we present a novel technique called LoadSense for a cellular client to obtain a measure of the cellular load, locally and passively, that allows the client to determine the ideal times for communication when available throughput to the client is likely to be high. Finally, we present the Peek-n-Sneak protocol, which enables a cellular client to &#39;peek&#39; into the channel and &#39;sneak&#39; in with its background communication when the conditions are suitable. When multiple clients in a cell perform Peen-n-Sneak, it enables them to coordinate their communications, implicitly and in an entirely distributed manner, akin to CSMA in wireless LANs, helping improve throughput (and reduce energy drain) for all.

We derive the conditions under which Nash equilibria are Paretooptimal, and we quantify the distance of Nash equilibria with respect to the set of Pareto-dominant points when the conditions are not satisfied; (iii) Finally, with extensive measurement-driven simulations we show that RAT selection games converge to Nash equilibria in a small number of steps, and hence are amenable to practical implementation. We also investigate the impact of noisy throughput measurements, and propose solutions to handle them. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper3.html" title="Read RAT selection games in HetNets"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel52"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ravindranath, Lenin, et al › <strong>Procrastinator: Pacing Mobile Apps’ Usage of the Network.</strong></a> <div id="panel52" class="content"> Many popular, professionally-written smartphone apps today prefetch large amounts of network data to improve performance. However, the typical user may not use all of this network data. When a user is on a limited or pay-per-byte cellular data plan, such as when roaming internationally, this prefetching behavior can cost her in overage fees on her cellular bill. This video demonstrates Procrastinator, which is a system that automatically decides when to fetch each network object that an app requests. This decision is made based on whether the user is on Wi-Fi or cellular, how many bytes are remaining on her data plan, and whether the object is needed at the present time. Procrastinator does not require app developer effort, nor app source code, nor OS changes -- it modifies the app binary to trap specific system calls and inject custom code. Our system can achieve as little as no savings to 4X reduction in total bytes transferred by an app, depending on the user and the app. These savings for the data-poor user come with a 300ms median latency penalty on LTE if the user goes to a part of the app where Procrastinator did not allow data to be prefetched. This video shows how main content on the primary page of apps is unaffected, and the delay that the user will typically experience if she goes to secondary pages in apps when she is running out of cellular data plan bytes.. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper2.html" title="Read Procrastinator: Pacing Mobile Apps’ Usage of the Network."><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel53"><span class="iconfont"></span> Pipes, Stephen, and Supriyo Chakraborty, IEEE 2014 › <strong>Multitiered inference management architecture for participatory sensing</strong></a> <div id="panel53" class="content"> This paper describes a multitiered architecture for realizing an inference management firewall (IMF) that employs context-aware information masking techniques for systematic management of risk-vs-value trade-off of sensor data.

Application delivery channels such as the Apple AppStore are transforming mobile phones into App Phones, capable of downloading a myriad of applications in an instant. Importantly, today&#39;s smartphones are programmable and come with a growing set of cheap powerful embedded sensors, such as an accelerometer, digital compass, gyroscope, GPS, microphone, and camera, which are enabling the emergence of personal, group, and communityscale sensing applications. We believe that sensor-equipped mobile phones will revolutionize many sectors of our economy, including business, healthcare, social networks, environmental monitoring, and transportation. In this article we survey existing mobile phone sensing algorithms, applications, and systems. We discuss the emerging sensing paradigms, and formulate an architectural framework for discussing a number of the open issues and challenges emerging in the new area of mobile phone sensing research. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper14.html" title="Read A survey of mobile phone sensing "><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel55"><span class="iconfont"></span> Miluzzo, Emiliano, et al › <strong>Darwin phones: the evolution of sensing and inference on mobile phones</strong></a> <div id="panel55" class="content"> We present Darwin, an enabling technology for mobile phone sensing that combines collaborative sensing and classification techniques to reason about human behavior and context on mobile phones. Darwin advances mobile phone sensing through the deployment of efficient but sophisticated machine learning techniques specifically designed to run directly on sensor-enabled mobile phones (i.e., smartphones). Darwin tackles three key sensing and inference challenges that are barriers to mass-scale adoption of mobile phone sensing applications: (i) the human-burden of training classifiers, (ii) the ability to perform reliably in different environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor) and (iii) the ability to scale to a large number of phones without jeopardizing the &#39;phone experience&#39; (e.g., usability and battery lifetime). Darwin is a collaborative reasoning framework built on three concepts: classifier/model evolution, model pooling, and collaborative inference. To the best of our knowledge Darwin is the first system that applies distributed machine learning techniques and collaborative inference concepts to mobile phones. We implement the Darwin system on the Nokia N97 and Apple iPhone. While Darwin represents a general framework applicable to a wide variety of emerging mobile sensing applications, we implement a speaker recognition application and an augmented reality application to evaluate the benefits of Darwin. We show experimental results from eight individuals carrying Nokia N97s and demonstrate that Darwin improves the reliability and scalability of the proof-of-concept speaker recognition application without additional burden to users. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper13.html" title="Read Darwin phones: the evolution of sensing and inference on mobile phones"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel56"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ganti, Raghu K., Fan Ye, and Hui Lei › <strong>Mobile crowdsensing: current state and future challenges</strong></a> <div id="panel56" class="content"> An emerging category of devices at the edge of the Internet are consumer-centric mobile sensing and computing devices, such as smartphones, music players, and in-vehicle sensors.

For many of these systems, their effectiveness fundamentally depends on coverage and the particular mobility patterns of the participants. Given the strong spatial and temporal regularity of human mobility, the needed coverage can typically only be attained through a large participant base. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to attain coverage without scale -- (soft) controlling the movement of participants. We present Crowd Soft Control (CSC), an approach to exert limited control over the temporal and spatial movements of mobile users by leveraging the built-in incentives of location-based gaming and social applications. By pairing network services with these location-based apps, CSC allows researchers to use an application&#39;s incentives (e.g. game objectives) to control the movement of participating users, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the associated network service. After outlining the case for Crowd Soft Control, we present an initial prototype of our ideas and discuss potential benefits and costs in the context of two case studies. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper11.html" title="Read Crowd (soft) control: moving beyond the opportunistic"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel58"><span class="iconfont"></span> Chon, Yohan, et al › <strong>Automatically characterizing places with opportunistic crowdsensing using smartphones.</strong></a> <div id="panel58" class="content"> Automated and scalable approaches for understanding the semantics of places are critical to improving both existing and emerging mobile services. In this paper, we present CrowdSense@Place (CSP), a framework that exploits a previously untapped resource -- opportunistically captured images and audio clips from smartphones -- to link place visits with place categories (e.g., store, restaurant). CSP combines signals based on location and user trajectories (using WiFi/GPS) along with various visual and audio place &#39;hints&#39; mined from opportunistic sensor data. Place hints include words spoken by people, text written on signs or objects recognized in the environment. We evaluate CSP with a seven-week, 36-user experiment involving 1,241 places in five locations around the world. Our results show that CSP can classify places into a variety of categories with an overall accuracy of 69%, outperforming currently available alternative solutions. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper10.html" title="Read Automatically characterizing places with opportunistic crowdsensing using smartphones."><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel59"><span class="iconfont"></span> Rula, John P., et al. ACM, 2014 › <strong>No one-size fits all: towards a principled approach for incentives in mobile crowdsourcing</strong></a> <div id="panel59" class="content"> We are becoming increasingly aware that the effectiveness of mobile crowdsourcing systems critically depends on the whims of their human participants, impacting everything from participant engagement to their compliance with the crowdsourced tasks. In response, a number of such systems have started to incorporate different incentive features aimed at a wide range of goals that span from improving participation levels, to extending the systems&#39; coverage, and enhancing the quality of the collected data. Despite the many related efforts, the inclusion of incentives in crowdsourced systems has so far been mostly ad-hoc, treating incentives as a wild-card response fitted for any occasion and goal. Using data from a large, 2-day experiment with 96 participants at a corporate conference, we present an analysis of the impact of two incentive structures on the recruitment, compliance and user effort of a basic mobile crowdsourced service. We build on these preliminary results to argue for a principled approach for selecting incentive and incentive structures to match the variety of requirements of mobile crowdsourcing applications and discuss key issues in working toward that goal. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper1.html" title="Read No one-size fits all: towards a principled approach for incentives in mobile crowdsourcing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel60"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ravindranath, Lenin, et al › <strong>Video: Procrastinator: pacing mobile apps' usage of the network</strong></a> <div id="panel60" class="content"> There are two emerging trends in the mobile data world. First, mobile data is exploding at a rapid rate with analysts predicting 25-50X growth by the year 2015. The second trend is that users are demanding greater degree of flexibility in selecting their operators at fine timescales. Across Asia, dual-SIM phones have become popular, while Apple is rumored to be designing a Universal SIM that will allow iPhone users to toggle between different operators. This latter trend points towards an impending disruption in wireless service models which could also be the need of the hour from the spectrum shortage perspective. This points towards a new service model where users can choose an operator based on application needs. However, if users make this choice greedily without network assistance, it can exacerbate spectrum scarcity and degrade user experience. In this work, we consider user devices with multiple network interfaces (3G, LTE etc.) that can be simultaneously active and each running multiple applications. We propose the MOTA service model to enable users to associate each interface with the operator of choice at fine time scales. Under the MOTA service model, through concise signalling information, operators provide information about their own network, so that each user can (i) choose a suitable operator for each interface, and (ii) choose an interface for each active application. We make the following contributions in this paper. First, we propose concise network signalling that assists users to make informed choices even under mobility. Second, we develop user-choice algorithms that maximize a suitable notion of user satisfaction while using spectrum resources efficiently. Third, we perform extensive evaluation over actual base station deployment in a city coupled with real signal propagation maps. Our results with two operators show that, MOTA service model provides capacity gain in the range 2.5-4X over the current existing service model. Finally, we argue that our solution is practically implementable by combining appropriate IEEE standards and IETF proposals. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper1.html" title="Read Video: Procrastinator: pacing mobile apps' usage of the network"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel61"><span class="iconfont"></span> Education › <strong>First MOOC on FOG</strong></a> <div id="panel61" class="content"> Fog Networks and the Internet of Things <a href="http://localhost:4000/news/2015/03/10/FOGCourse.html" title="Read First MOOC on FOG"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> </dl> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="up-to-top" class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="subfooter"> <nav class="row"> <section id="subfooter-left" class="b30 small-12 medium-6 columns"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li>© 2014 Board of Trustees Princeton University | Designed and developed at the Princeton EDGE Lab </li> </ul> </section> <section id="subfooter-right" class="small-12 medium-6 columns social-icons"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-twitter" title="Immer das Neuste von Phlow gibt es auf Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-github" title="Code und mehr..."></a></li> </ul> </section> </nav> </div><!-- /#subfooter --> </footer> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/javascript.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
