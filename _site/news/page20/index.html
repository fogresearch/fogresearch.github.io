Our solution is centered on smart home gateways that allocate bandwidth in a two-level hierarchy: first, a gateway purchases guaranteed bandwidth from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) with virtual credits. It then self-limits its bandwidth usage and distributes the bandwidth among its apps and devices according to their relative priorities. To this end, we design a credit allocation and redistribution mechanism for the first level, and implement our gateways on commodity wireless routers for the second level. We demonstrate our system&#39;s effectiveness and practicality with theoretical analysis, simulations and experiments on real traffic. Compared to a baseline equal sharing algorithm, our solution significantly improves users&#39; overall satisfaction and yields a fair allocation of bandwidth across users.. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper4/" title="Read Mind Your Own Bandwidth: An Edge Solution to Peak-hour Broadband Congestion"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a> </p> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns b60"> <p class="subheadline"><span class="subheader">researchpaper</span> – Aryafar, Ehsan, et al </p> <h2><a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper3/">RAT selection games in HetNets</a></h2> <p> We study the dynamics of network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets). Users in such networks selfishly select the best radio access technology (RAT) with the objective of maximizing their own throughputs. We propose two general classes of throughput models that capture the basic properties of random access (e.g., Wi-Fi) and scheduled access (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, 3G) networks. Next, we formulate the problem as a non-cooperative game, and study its convergence, efficiency, and practicality. Our results reveal that: (i) Singleclass RAT selection games converge to Nash equilibria, while an improvement path can be repeated infinitely with a mixture of classes. We next introduce a hysteresis mechanism in RAT selection games, and prove that with appropriate hysteresis policies, convergence can still be guaranteed; (ii) We analyze the Pareto-efficiency of the Nash equilibria of these games. We derive the conditions under which Nash equilibria are Paretooptimal, and we quantify the distance of Nash equilibria with respect to the set of Pareto-dominant points when the conditions are not satisfied; (iii) Finally, with extensive measurement-driven simulations we show that RAT selection games converge to Nash equilibria in a small number of steps, and hence are amenable to practical implementation. We also investigate the impact of noisy throughput measurements, and propose solutions to handle them. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper3/" title="Read RAT selection games in HetNets"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a> </p> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns b60"> <p class="subheadline"><span class="subheader">researchpaper</span> – Ravindranath, Lenin, et al </p> <h2><a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper2/">Procrastinator: Pacing Mobile Apps’ Usage of the Network.</a></h2> <p> Many popular, professionally-written smartphone apps today prefetch large amounts of network data to improve performance. However, the typical user may not use all of this network data. When a user is on a limited or pay-per-byte cellular data plan, such as when roaming internationally, this prefetching behavior can cost her in overage fees on her cellular bill. This video demonstrates Procrastinator, which is a system that automatically decides when to fetch each network object that an app requests. This decision is made based on whether the user is on Wi-Fi or cellular, how many bytes are remaining on her data plan, and whether the object is needed at the present time. Procrastinator does not require app developer effort, nor app source code, nor OS changes -- it modifies the app binary to trap specific system calls and inject custom code. Our system can achieve as little as no savings to 4X reduction in total bytes transferred by an app, depending on the user and the app. These savings for the data-poor user come with a 300ms median latency penalty on LTE if the user goes to a part of the app where Procrastinator did not allow data to be prefetched. This video shows how main content on the primary page of apps is unaffected, and the delay that the user will typically experience if she goes to secondary pages in apps when she is running out of cellular data plan bytes.. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper2/" title="Read Procrastinator: Pacing Mobile Apps’ Usage of the Network."><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a> </p> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns b60"> <p class="subheadline"><span class="subheader">researchpaper</span> – Balakrishnan, Hari, Hariharan S.

Our work is motivated by trends in traffic patterns that threaten the long-term stability of the Internet. These trends include the use of multiple independent concurrent flows by Web applications and the increasing use of transport protocols and applications that do not adapt to congestion. We present an end-system architecture centered around a Congestion Manager (CM) that ensures proper congestion behavior and allows applications to easily adapt to network congestion. Our framework integrates congestion management across all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains congestion parameters and exposes an API to enable applications to learn about network characteristics, pass information to the CM, and schedule data transmissions. Internally, it uses a window-based control algorithm, a scheduler to regulate transmissions, and a lightweight protocol to elicit feedback from receivers.We describe how TCP and an adaptive real-time streaming audio application can be implemented using the CM. Our simulation results show that an ensemble of concurrent TCP connections can effectively share bandwidth and obtain consistent performance, without adversely affecting other network flows. Our results also show that the CM enables audio applications to adapt to congestion conditions without having to perform congestion control or bandwidth probing on their own. We conclude that the CM provides a useful and pragmatic framework for building adaptive Internet applications. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper12/" title="Read An integrated congestion management architecture for Internet hosts"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a> </p> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns b60"> <p class="subheadline"><span class="subheader">researchpaper</span> – Misra, Vishal, et al</p> <h2><a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper11/">Incentivizing peer-assisted services: a fluid shapley value approach</a></h2> <p> A new generation of content delivery networks for live streaming, video on demand, and software updates takes advantage of a peer-to-peer architecture to reduce their operating cost. In contrast with previous uncoordinated peer-to-peer schemes, users opt-in to dedicate part of the resources they own to help the content delivery, in exchange for receiving the same service at a reduced price. Such incentive mechanisms are appealing, as they simplify coordination and accounting. However, they also increase a user&#39;s expectation that she will receive a fair price for the resources she provides. Addressing this issue carefully is critical in ensuring that all interested parties--including the provider--are willing to participate in such a system, thereby guaranteeing its stability. In this paper, we take a cooperative game theory approach to identify the ideal incentive structure that follows the axioms formulated by Lloyd Shapley. This ensures that each player, be it the provider or a peer, receives an amount proportional to its contribution and bargaining power when entering the game. In general, the drawback of this ideal incentive structure is its computational complexity. However, we prove that as the number of peers receiving the service becomes large, the Shapley value received by each player approaches a fluid limit. This limit follows a simple closed form expression and can be computed in several scenarios of interest: by applying our technique, we show that several peer-assisted services, deployed on both wired and wireless networks, can benefit from important cost and energy savings with a proper incentive structure that follows simple compensation rules. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/client-paper11/" title="Read Incentivizing peer-assisted services: a fluid shapley value approach"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a> </p> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <nav id="pagination"> <a class="radius button small" href="https://fogresearch.github.io/news/page19/" title="Previous Posts">&laquo; Previous</a> <a class="radius button small" href="https://fogresearch.github.io/news/archive/" title="News Archive">News Archive</a> <a class="radius button small" href="https://fogresearch.github.io/news/page21/" title="Next Posts">Next &raquo;</a> </nav> </div><!-- /.medium-7.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="up-to-top" class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="subfooter"> <nav class="row"> <section id="subfooter-left" class="b30 small-12 medium-6 columns"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li>© 2014 Board of Trustees Princeton University | Designed and developed at the Princeton EDGE Lab with JEKYLL using FEELING RESPONSIVE theme</li> </ul> </section> <section id="subfooter-right" class="small-12 medium-6 columns social-icons"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-twitter" title="Immer das Neuste von Phlow gibt es auf Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-github" title="Code und mehr..."></a></li> </ul> </section> </nav> </div><!-- /#subfooter --> </footer> <script src="https://fogresearch.github.io/assets/js/javascript.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-63541329-1', 'auto'); ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
