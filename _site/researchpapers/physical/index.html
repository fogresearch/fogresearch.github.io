The activities in many wireless standardization bodies and forums, for example IEEE 802.16 j/m and LTE-Advanced, attest to this fact. The availability or lack thereof of efficient radio resource management (RRM) could make or mar the opportunities in these networks. Although distributed schemes are more attractive, it is essential to seek outstanding performance benchmarks to which various decentralized schemes can be compared. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive centralized RRM algorithm for downlink OFDMA cellular fixed relay networks in a way to ensure user fairness with minimal impact on network throughput. In contrast, it has been observed that pure opportunistic schemes and fairness-aware schemes relying solely on achievable and allocated capacities may not attain the desired fairness, e.g., proportional fair scheduling. The proposed scheme is queue-aware and performs three functions jointly; dynamic routing, fair scheduling, and load balancing among cell nodes. We show that the proposed centralized scheme is different from the traditional centralized schemes in terms of the substantial savings in complexity and feedback overhead. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/03/paper9.html" title="Read Fairness-aware radio resource management in downlink OFDMA cellular relay networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel2"><span class="iconfont"></span> Salem, Mohamed, et al › <strong>An overview of radio resource management in relay-enhanced OFDMA-based networks</strong></a> <div id="panel2" class="content"> Researchers in both academia and industry have accepted OFDMA as the most appropriate air-interface for the emerging broadband wireless access networks and standards. A number of IEEE working groups and various research forums are focusing on developing relay and mesh-enabled networks with cooperative communication features. Among these research efforts are IEEE 802.11s, IEEE 802.16j/m, and 3GPP&#39;s advanced long term evolution (LTE-advanced). The combination of OFDMA with relaying techniques provides rich opportunities for cost-effective and high-performance networks. To exploit such opportunities requires intelligent radio resource management (RRM) algorithms. Although a number of publications have highlighted the important and challenging issues involved in designing RRM algorithms for OFDMA networks, only recently a number of papers have investigated relay-enhanced OFDMA-based multicellular networks. By and large, the literature indicates that these issues constitute a hot research topic that will continue to attract interest. This paper provides a survey of the current literature on OFDMA networks enhanced with decode-and-forward relaying and provides their link to earlier literature in non-OFDMA networks. In addition, a rich list of references is provided to direct the readers toward some of the emerging techniques. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/03/paper8.html" title="Read An overview of radio resource management in relay-enhanced OFDMA-based networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel3"><span class="iconfont"></span> Joseph, Vinay, and Gustavo De Veciana › <strong>Stochastic networks with multipath flow control: impact of resource pools on flow-level performance and network congestion</strong></a> <div id="panel3" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/03/paper7.html" title="Read Stochastic networks with multipath flow control: impact of resource pools on flow-level performance and network congestion"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel4"><span class="iconfont"></span> Yeow, Wai-Leong, Cédric Westphal, and Ulas C.

However, delays of all VoIP flows dramatically increase when network capacity is approached. Additionally, unfair traffic distribution between downlink and uplink flows in WLANs impacts the perceived VoIP quality. This paper proposes an intelligent bandwidth management scheme for VoIP services (iVoIP) that improves bandwidth utilization and provides fair downlink–uplink channel access. iVoIP is a cross-layer solution which includes two components: (1) iVoIP-Admission Control, which protects the quality of existing flows and increases the utilization of wireless network resources; (2) iVoIP-Fairness scheme, which balances the channel access opportunity between access point (AP) and wireless stations. iVoIP-Admission Control limits the number of VoIP flows based on an estimation of VoIP capacity. iVoIP-Fairness implements a contention window adaptation scheme at AP which uses stereotypes and considers several major quality of service parameters to balance the network access of downlink and uplink flows, respectively. Extensive simulations and real tests have been performed, demonstrating that iVoIP has both very good VoIP capacity estimation and admission control results. Additionally, iVoIP improves the downlink/uplink fairness level in terms of throughput, delay, loss, and VoIP quality. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/03/paper2.html" title="Read iVoIP: an intelligent bandwidth management scheme for VoIP in WLANs"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel9"><span class="iconfont"></span> Salem, Mohamed, et al › <strong>A noncooperative game-theoretic framework for radio resource management in 4G heterogeneous wireless access networks</strong></a> <div id="panel9" class="content"> Fourth generation (4G) wireless networks will provide high-bandwidth connectivity with quality-of-service (QoS) support to mobile users in a seamless manner. In such a scenario, a mobile user will be able to connect to different wireless access networks such as a wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN), a cellular network, and a wireless local area network (WLAN) simultaneously. We present a game-theoretic framework for radio resource management (that is, bandwidth allocation and admission control) in such a heterogeneous wireless access environment. First, a noncooperative game is used to obtain the bandwidth allocations to a service area from the different access networks available in that service area (on a long-term basis). The Nash equilibrium for this game gives the optimal allocation which maximizes the utilities of all the connections in the network (that is, in all of the service areas). Second, based on the obtained bandwidth allocation, to prioritize vertical and horizontal handoff connections over new connections, a bargaining game is formulated to obtain the capacity reservation thresholds so that the connection-level QoS requirements can be satisfied for the different types of connections (on a long-term basis). Third, we formulate a noncooperative game to obtain the amount of bandwidth allocated to an arriving connection (in a service area) by the different access networks (on a short-term basis). Based on the allocated bandwidth and the capacity reservation thresholds, an admission control is used to limit the number of ongoing connections so that the QoS performances are maintained at the target level for the different types of connections. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/03/paper11.html" title="Read A noncooperative game-theoretic framework for radio resource management in 4G heterogeneous wireless access networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel10"><span class="iconfont"></span> Kulkarni, Parag, Woon Hau Chin, and Tim Farnham › <strong>Radio resource management considerations for LTE femto cells</strong></a> <div id="panel10" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/03/paper10.html" title="Read Radio resource management considerations for LTE femto cells"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel11"><span class="iconfont"></span> Wamser, Florian, et al › <strong>Dynamic bandwidth allocation for multiple network connections: improving user QoE and network usage of YouTube in mobile broadband</strong></a> <div id="panel11" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/03/paper1.html" title="Read Dynamic bandwidth allocation for multiple network connections: improving user QoE and network usage of YouTube in mobile broadband"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> </dl> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div> <!-- /.row --> </span> </article> </div><!-- /.medium-8.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="up-to-top" class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="subfooter"> <nav class="row"> <section id="subfooter-left" class="b30 small-12 medium-6 columns"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li>© 2014 Board of Trustees Princeton University | Designed and developed at the Princeton EDGE Lab with JEKYLL using FEELING RESPONSIVE theme</li> </ul> </section> <section id="subfooter-right" class="small-12 medium-6 columns social-icons"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-twitter" title="Immer das Neuste von Phlow gibt es auf Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-github" title="Code und mehr..."></a></li> </ul> </section> </nav> </div><!-- /#subfooter --> </footer> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/javascript.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
