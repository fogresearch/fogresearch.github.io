However, many other complementary technologies are reaching a high level of maturity. Their interplay may dramatically shift the in- formation and communication technology landscape in the following years, bringing separate technologies into a com- mon ground. This paper offers a comprehensive definition of the fog, comprehending technologies as diverse as cloud, sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks, network virtualisa- tion functions or configuration management techniques. We highlight the main challenges faced by this potentially break- through technology amalgamation. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/news/paper16/" title="Read Finding your Way in the Fog: Towards a Comprehensive Definition of Fog Computing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel2"><span class="iconfont"></span> Stauffer, Michael › <strong>Connectivity solutions for smart TVs</strong></a> <div id="panel2" class="content"> Consumer demand for enjoying any content anywhere, any time, and on any device is driving the need for reliable connectivity between content sources and consumption devices inside the home.

Relative to the traditional cellular methods, there is a need to design new peer discovery methods, physical layer procedures, and radio resource management algorithms that help realize the potential advantages of D2D communications. In this article we use the 3GPP Long Term Evolution system as a baseline for D2D design, review some of the key design challenges, and propose solution approaches that allow cellular devices and D2D pairs to share spectrum resources and thereby increase the spectrum and energy efficiency of traditional cellular networks. Simulation results illustrate the viability of the proposed design. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper7/" title="Read Design aspects of network assisted device-to-device communications"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel5"><span class="iconfont"></span> Essaili, A.

Our objective is to enhance the user experience in adaptive HTTP streaming by jointly considering the characteristics of the media content and the available wireless resources in the operator network. Specifically, we propose a proactive QoE-based approach for rewriting the client HTTP requests at a proxy in the mobile network. The advantage of the proposed approach is its applicability for over-the-top (OTT) streaming as it requires no adaptation of the media content. We compare our proposed scheme to both reactive QoE-optimized and to standard-DASH HTTP streaming. Our contributions are: 1) We first show that standard OTT DASH leads to unsatisfactory performance since the content agnostic resource allocation by the LTE scheduler is far from optimal, and we can achieve a clear QoE improvement when considering the content characteristics. 2) We additionally show that proactively rewriting the client requests gives control of the video content adaptation to the network operator which has better information than the client on the load and radio conditions in the cell. This results in additional gains in user perceived video quality. 3) A standard unmodified DASH client remains unaware of the proposed rewriting of the HTTP requests and can decode and play the redirected media segments. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper6/" title="Read Quality-of-experience driven adaptive HTTP media delivery"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel6"><span class="iconfont"></span> Brush, A.

Mainly motivated by increasing healthcare costs and propelled by recent technological advances in miniature biosensing devices, smart textiles, microelectronics, and wireless communications, the continuous advance of wearable sensor-based systems will potentially transform the future of healthcare by enabling proactive personal health management and ubiquitous monitoring of a patient&#39;s health condition. These systems can comprise various types of small physiological sensors, transmission modules and processing capabilities, and can thus facilitate low-cost wearable unobtrusive solutions for continuous all-day and any-place health, mental and activity status monitoring. This paper attempts to comprehensively review the current research and development on wearable biosensor systems for health monitoring. A variety of system implementations are compared in an approach to identify the technological shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art in wearable biosensor solutions. An emphasis is given to multiparameter physiological sensing system designs, providing reliable vital signs measurements and incorporating real-time decision support for early detection of symptoms or context awareness. In order to evaluate the maturity level of the top current achievements in wearable health-monitoring systems, a set of significant features, that best describe the functionality and the characteristics of the systems, has been selected to derive a thorough study. The aim of this survey is not to criticize, but to serve as a reference for researchers and developers in this scientific area and to provide direction for future research improvements <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper15/" title="Read A survey on wearable sensor-based systems for health monitoring and prognosis"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel11"><span class="iconfont"></span> Wu, Geng, et al › <strong>M2M: From mobile to embedded internet</strong></a> <div id="panel11" class="content"> Is M2M hype or the future of our information society?

We analyze the future directions of air interface technology improvements and network architectures evolution to enable the mass deployment of M2M services. In particular, we consider the salient features of M2M traffic that may not be supported efficiently by present standards, and provide an overview of potential enhancements.

In this article, we first identify the fundamental challenges in home M2M networks. Then we present the architecture of home M2M networks decomposed into three subareas depending on the radio service ranges and potential applications. Finally, we focus on QoS management in home M2M networks, considering the increasing number of multimedia devices and growing visual requirements in a home area. Three standards for multimedia sharing and their QoS architectures are outlined. Cross-layer joint admission and rate control design is reported for QoS-aware multimedia sharing. This proposed strategy is aware of the QoS requirements and resilience of multimedia services. Illustrative results indicate that the joint design is able to intelligently allocate radio bandwidth based on QoS demands in resource-constrained home M2M networks. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper12/" title="Read Home M2M networks: architectures, standards, and QoS improvement"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel14"><span class="iconfont"></span> Lien, Shao-Yu, Kwang-Cheng Chen, and Yonghua Lin › <strong>Toward ubiquitous massive accesses in 3GPP machine-to-machine communications</strong></a> <div id="panel14" class="content"> To enable full mechanical automation where each smart device can play multiple roles among sensor, decision maker, and action executor, it is essential to construct scrupulous connections among all devices. Machine-to-machine communications thus emerge to achieve ubiquitous communications among all devices. With the merit of providing higher-layer connections, scenarios of 3GPP have been regarded as the promising solution facilitating M2M communications, which is being standardized as an emphatic application to be supported by LTE-Advanced. However, distinct features in M2M communications create diverse challenges from those in human-to-human communications. To deeply understand M2M communications in 3GPP, in this article, we provide an overview of the network architecture and features of M2M communications in 3GPP, and identify potential issues on the air interface, including physical layer transmissions, the random access procedure, and radio resources allocation supporting the most critical QoS provisioning. An effective solution is further proposed to provide QoS guarantees to facilitate M2M applications with inviolable hard timing constraints. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper11/" title="Read Toward ubiquitous massive accesses in 3GPP machine-to-machine communications"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel15"><span class="iconfont"></span> Zhang, Bo, et al › <strong>LocalTree: An efficient algorithm for mobile peer-to-peer live streaming</strong></a> <div id="panel15" class="content"> To provide live streaming service to mobile users, traditionally each user pulls content from a server over his cellular network. In order to overcome the scalability problem of last-hop bandwidth bottleneck, mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming can be used where mobile devices relay their stream received in a multi-hop manner by means of a secondary channel (such as Wi-Fi or bluetooth). We investigate the design of distributed algorithm termed LocalTree, which minimizes the number of broadcasters while meeting a certain video quality requirement under peer churns. We first formulate the problem and show that it is NP-hard, and hence propose LocalTree which achieves robustness similar to an unstructured mesh and low delay similar to a global tree. Simulation results show that LocalTree outperforms other algorithms substantially in terms of number of broadcasters used (by as much as 50%). <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper10/" title="Read LocalTree: An efficient algorithm for mobile peer-to-peer live streaming"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel16"><span class="iconfont"></span> Bonomi, Flavio, et al › <strong>Fog Computing: A Platform for Internet of Things and Analytics</strong></a> <div id="panel16" class="content"> Internet of Things (IoT) brings more than an explosive proliferation of endpoints.
