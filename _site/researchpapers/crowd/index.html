We experimentally show that mobile data mining provides an efficient and scalable approach for data collection for mobile crowdsensing. Our approach results in reducing the amount of data sent, as well as the energy usage on the mobile phone, while providing comparable levels of accuracy to traditional models of intermittent/continuous sensing and sending. We have implemented our Context-Aware Real-time Open Mobile Miner (CAROMM) to facilitate data collection from mobile users for crowdsensing applications. CAROMM also collects and correlates this real-time sensory information with social media data from both Twitter and Facebook. CAROMM supports delivering real-time information to mobile users for queries that pertain to specific locations of interest. We have evaluated our framework by collecting real-time data over a period of days from mobile users and experimentally demonstrated that mobile data mining is an effective and efficient strategy for mobile crowdsensing <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper9/" title="Read Using on-the-move mining for mobile crowdsensing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel2"><span class="iconfont"></span> Rai, Anshul, et al › <strong>Zee: zero-effort crowdsourcing for indoor localization</strong></a> <div id="panel2" class="content"> Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting, based onWiFi or cellular signals, has been a popular approach to indoor localization. However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for sitespecific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee -- a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user&#39;s initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length,(c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of ocalization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence. We present an evaluation of Zee in a large office building. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper8/" title="Read Zee: zero-effort crowdsourcing for indoor localization"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel3"><span class="iconfont"></span> Demirbas, Murat, Yavuz Selim Yilmaz, and Muhammed Fatih Bulut (PERCOM WORKSHOPS), IEEE 2013 › <strong>Eywa: Crowdsourced and cloudsourced omniscience</strong></a> <div id="panel3" class="content"> Here we present our ubiquitous computing vision, Eywa.

This, in turn, calls for scheduling the background communication so as to maximize the throughput. It has been recognized in prior work that a key determinant of throughput is the wireless link quality. However, as we show here, another key factor is the load in the cell, arising from the communication of other nodes. Unlike link quality, the only way, thus far, for a cellular client to obtain a measure of load has been to perform active probing, which defeats the goal of minimizing the active duration of the radio. In this paper, we address the above dilemma by making the following contributions. First, we show experimentally that to obtain good throughput, considering link quality alone is insufficient, and that cellular load must also be factored in. Second, we present a novel technique called LoadSense for a cellular client to obtain a measure of the cellular load, locally and passively, that allows the client to determine the ideal times for communication when available throughput to the client is likely to be high. Finally, we present the Peek-n-Sneak protocol, which enables a cellular client to &#39;peek&#39; into the channel and &#39;sneak&#39; in with its background communication when the conditions are suitable. When multiple clients in a cell perform Peen-n-Sneak, it enables them to coordinate their communications, implicitly and in an entirely distributed manner, akin to CSMA in wireless LANs, helping improve throughput (and reduce energy drain) for all. Our experimental evaluation shows overall device energy savings of 20-60% even when Peek-n-Sneak is deployed incrementally <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper3/" title="Read Coordinating cellular background transfers using loadsense"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel8"><span class="iconfont"></span> Pipes, Stephen, and Supriyo Chakraborty, IEEE 2014 › <strong>Multitiered inference management architecture for participatory sensing</strong></a> <div id="panel8" class="content"> This paper describes a multitiered architecture for realizing an inference management firewall (IMF) that employs context-aware information masking techniques for systematic management of risk-vs-value trade-off of sensor data.

Darwin advances mobile phone sensing through the deployment of efficient but sophisticated machine learning techniques specifically designed to run directly on sensor-enabled mobile phones (i.e., smartphones). Darwin tackles three key sensing and inference challenges that are barriers to mass-scale adoption of mobile phone sensing applications: (i) the human-burden of training classifiers, (ii) the ability to perform reliably in different environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor) and (iii) the ability to scale to a large number of phones without jeopardizing the &#39;phone experience&#39; (e.g., usability and battery lifetime). Darwin is a collaborative reasoning framework built on three concepts: classifier/model evolution, model pooling, and collaborative inference. To the best of our knowledge Darwin is the first system that applies distributed machine learning techniques and collaborative inference concepts to mobile phones. We implement the Darwin system on the Nokia N97 and Apple iPhone. While Darwin represents a general framework applicable to a wide variety of emerging mobile sensing applications, we implement a speaker recognition application and an augmented reality application to evaluate the benefits of Darwin. We show experimental results from eight individuals carrying Nokia N97s and demonstrate that Darwin improves the reliability and scalability of the proof-of-concept speaker recognition application without additional burden to users. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper13/" title="Read Darwin phones: the evolution of sensing and inference on mobile phones"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel11"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ganti, Raghu K., Fan Ye, and Hui Lei › <strong>Mobile crowdsensing: current state and future challenges</strong></a> <div id="panel11" class="content"> An emerging category of devices at the edge of the Internet are consumer-centric mobile sensing and computing devices, such as smartphones, music players, and in-vehicle sensors.

For many of these systems, their effectiveness fundamentally depends on coverage and the particular mobility patterns of the participants. Given the strong spatial and temporal regularity of human mobility, the needed coverage can typically only be attained through a large participant base. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to attain coverage without scale -- (soft) controlling the movement of participants. We present Crowd Soft Control (CSC), an approach to exert limited control over the temporal and spatial movements of mobile users by leveraging the built-in incentives of location-based gaming and social applications. By pairing network services with these location-based apps, CSC allows researchers to use an application&#39;s incentives (e.g. game objectives) to control the movement of participating users, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the associated network service. After outlining the case for Crowd Soft Control, we present an initial prototype of our ideas and discuss potential benefits and costs in the context of two case studies. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper11/" title="Read Crowd (soft) control: moving beyond the opportunistic"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel13"><span class="iconfont"></span> Chon, Yohan, et al › <strong>Automatically characterizing places with opportunistic crowdsensing using smartphones.</strong></a> <div id="panel13" class="content"> Automated and scalable approaches for understanding the semantics of places are critical to improving both existing and emerging mobile services.

CSP combines signals based on location and user trajectories (using WiFi/GPS) along with various visual and audio place &#39;hints&#39; mined from opportunistic sensor data. Place hints include words spoken by people, text written on signs or objects recognized in the environment. We evaluate CSP with a seven-week, 36-user experiment involving 1,241 places in five locations around the world.

In response, a number of such systems have started to incorporate different incentive features aimed at a wide range of goals that span from improving participation levels, to extending the systems&#39; coverage, and enhancing the quality of the collected data. Despite the many related efforts, the inclusion of incentives in crowdsourced systems has so far been mostly ad-hoc, treating incentives as a wild-card response fitted for any occasion and goal. Using data from a large, 2-day experiment with 96 participants at a corporate conference, we present an analysis of the impact of two incentive structures on the recruitment, compliance and user effort of a basic mobile crowdsourced service. We build on these preliminary results to argue for a principled approach for selecting incentive and incentive structures to match the variety of requirements of mobile crowdsourcing applications and discuss key issues in working toward that goal. <a href="https://fogresearch.github.io/researchpaper/paper1/" title="Read No one-size fits all: towards a principled approach for incentives in mobile crowdsourcing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> </dl> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div> <!-- /.row --> </span> <div id="page-meta" class="t30"> <p> <!-- Look the author details up from the site config. --> <!-- Output author details if some exist. --> </span> <br> <span class="pr20"></span> </p> <div id="post-nav" class="row"> <div class="small-2 columns text-center"><a class="radius button small" href="https://fogresearch.github.io/blog/archive/" title="Blog Archive">Archive</a></div><!-- /.small-4.columns --> </div> </div><!-- /.page-meta --> </article> </div><!-- /.medium-8.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="up-to-top" class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="subfooter"> <nav class="row"> <section id="subfooter-left" class="b30 small-12 medium-6 columns"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li>© 2014 Board of Trustees Princeton University | Designed and developed at the Princeton EDGE Lab with JEKYLL using FEELING RESPONSIVE theme</li> </ul> </section> <section id="subfooter-right" class="small-12 medium-6 columns social-icons"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-twitter" title="Immer das Neuste von Phlow gibt es auf Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-github" title="Code und mehr..."></a></li> </ul> </section> </nav> </div><!-- /#subfooter --> </footer> <script src="https://fogresearch.github.io/assets/js/javascript.min.js"></script> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-63541329-1', 'auto'); ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
