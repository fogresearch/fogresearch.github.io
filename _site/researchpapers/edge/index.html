The request process is governed by the objects&#39; popularity and varies across network regions and over time. In order to meet user requests, content objects can be stored and transported over the network, characterized by the capacity and energy efficiency of the storage and transport resources. The energy efficient dynamic in-network caching problem aims at finding the evolution of the network configuration, in terms of the content objects being cached and transported over each network element at any given time, that meets user requests, satisfies network resource capacities and minimizes overall energy use. We provide 1) an information-centric optimization framework for the energy efficient dynamic in-network caching problem, 2) an offline solution, EE-OFD, based on an integer linear program (ILP) that obtains the maximum efficiency gains that can be achieved with global knowledge of user requests and network resources, and 3) an efficient fully distributed online solution, EEOND, that allows network nodes to make local caching decisions based on their current estimate of the global energy benefit. Our solutions take into account the network heterogeneity, in terms of capacity, energy efficiency and content popularity, and adapt to changing network conditions minimizing overall energy use. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper8.html" title="Read Dynamic in-network caching for energy efficient content delivery"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel3"><span class="iconfont"></span> Nawaz, Sarfraz, Christos Efstratiou, and Cecilia Mascolo › <strong>ParkSense: a smartphone based sensing system for on-street parking</strong></a> <div id="panel3" class="content"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper7.html" title="Read ParkSense: a smartphone based sensing system for on-street parking"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel4"><span class="iconfont"></span> Rossi, Mirco, et al › <strong>AmbientSense: A real-time ambient sound recognition system for smartphones</strong></a> <div id="panel4" class="content"> This paper presents design, implementation, and evaluation of AmbientSense, a real-time ambient sound recognition system on a smartphone. AmbientSense continuously recognizes user context by analyzing ambient sounds sampled from a smartphone&#39;s microphone. The phone provides a user with realtime feedback on recognised context. AmbientSense is implemented as an Android app and works in two modes: in autonomous mode processing is performed on the smartphone only. In server mode recognition is done by transmitting audio features to a server and receiving classification results back. We evaluated both modes in a set of 23 daily life ambient sound classes and describe recognition performance, phone CPU load, and recognition delay. The application runs with a fully charged battery up to 13.75 h on a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone and up to 12.87 h on a Google Nexus One phone. Runtime and CPU load were similar for autonomous and server modes. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper6.html" title="Read AmbientSense: A real-time ambient sound recognition system for smartphones"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel5"><span class="iconfont"></span> Rachuri, Kiran K., et al › <strong>METIS: Exploring mobile phone sensing offloading for efficiently supporting social sensing applications</strong></a> <div id="panel5" class="content"> Mobile phones play a pivotal role in supporting ubiquitous and unobtrusive sensing of human activities. However, maintaining a highly accurate record of a user&#39;s behavior throughout the day imposes significant energy demands on the phone&#39;s battery. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of METIS: an adaptive mobile sensing platform that efficiently supports social sensing applications. The platform implements a novel sensor task distribution scheme that dynamically decides whether to perform sensing on the phone or in the infrastructure, considering the energy consumption, accuracy, and mobility patterns of the user. By comparing the sensing distribution scheme with sensing performed solely on the phone or exclusively on the fixed remote sensors, we show, through benchmarks using real traces, that the opportunistic sensing distribution achieves over 60% and 40% energy savings, respectively. This is confirmed through a real world deployment in an office environment for over a month: we developed a social application over our frameworks, that is able to infer the collaborations and meetings of the users. In this setting the system preserves over 35% more battery life over pure phone sensing. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper5.html" title="Read METIS: Exploring mobile phone sensing offloading for efficiently supporting social sensing applications"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel6"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ren, Shaolei, and Mihaela van der Schaar › <strong>Efficient Resource Provisioning and Rate Selection for Stream Mining in a Community Cloud</strong></a> <div id="panel6" class="content"> Real-time stream mining such as surveillance and personal health monitoring, which involves sophisticated mathematical operations, is computation-intensive and prohibitive for mobile devices due to the hardware/computation constraints. To satisfy the growing demand for stream mining in mobile networks, we propose to employ a cloud-based stream mining system in which the mobile devices send via wireless links unclassified media streams to the cloud for classification. We aim at minimizing the classification-energy cost, defined as an affine combination of classification cost and energy consumption at the cloud, subject to an average stream mining delay constraint (which is important in real-time applications). To address the challenge of time-varying wireless channel conditions without a priori information about the channel statistics, we develop an online algorithm in which the cloud operator can dynamically adjust its resource provisioning on the fly and the mobile devices can adapt their transmission rates to the instantaneous channel conditions. It is proved that, at the expense of increasing the average stream mining delay, the online algorithm achieves a classification-energy cost that can be pushed arbitrarily close to the minimum cost achieved by the optimal offline algorithm. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the analysis. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper4.html" title="Read Efficient Resource Provisioning and Rate Selection for Stream Mining in a Community Cloud"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel7"><span class="iconfont"></span> Xu, Jie, et al › <strong>Non-Stationary Resource Allocation Policies for Delay-Constrained Video Streaming: Application to Video over Internet-of-Things-Enabled Networks</strong></a> <div id="panel7" class="content"> Due to the high bandwidth requirements and stringent delay constraints of multi-user wireless video transmission applications, ensuring that all video senders have sufficient transmission opportunities to use before their delay deadlines expire is a longstanding research problem. We propose a novel solution that addresses this problem without assuming detailed packet-level knowledge, which is unavailable at resource allocation time (i.e. prior to the actual compression and transmission). Instead, we translate the transmission delay deadlines of each sender&#39;s video packets into a monotonically-decreasing weight distribution within the considered time horizon. Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability for deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders&#39; video streams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA) approach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the deadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA approach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy that depends on the allocation of previous slots. This is in contrast with all existing slot allocation policies such as round-robin or rate-adaptive round-robin policies, which are stationary because the allocation of the current slot does not depend on the allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal for weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time. We further implement our framework for real-time video streaming in wireless personal area networks that are gaining significant traction within the new Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. For multiple surveillance videos encoded with H.264/AVC and streamed via the 6tisch framework that simulates the IoT-oriented IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH medium access control, our solution is shown to be the only one that ensures all video bitstreams are delivered with acceptable quality in a deadline-- biding manner. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper3.html" title="Read Non-Stationary Resource Allocation Policies for Delay-Constrained Video Streaming: Application to Video over Internet-of-Things-Enabled Networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel8"><span class="iconfont"></span> Li, Qian, et al › <strong>Edge Cloud and Underlay Networks: Empowering 5G Cell-Less Wireless Architecture</strong></a> <div id="panel8" class="content"> The 5th generation wireless communication networks are expected to face the challenge of providing satisfactory - in terms of user experience - connections to ten or even hundred times more connected devices than today. To meet such challenge, a revolutionary change in the network architecture is required. In this paper, we discuss potential directions for the future wireless network architecture and key techniques. An edge cloud and underlay network architecture is proposed by leveraging techniques such as network virtualization, edge computing, local traffic offloading, cloudbased control and processing for improving the overall network efficiency and user experience. This technology advance forms the foundation of the next generation wireless network architecture. Case studies on key enabling techniques of the proposed edge cloud and underlay network architecture are presented together with preliminary design concepts and numerical results. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper2.html" title="Read Edge Cloud and Underlay Networks: Empowering 5G Cell-Less Wireless Architecture"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel9"><span class="iconfont"></span> Won, Stephen, et al › <strong>A Design Methodology for Distributed Adaptive Stream Mining Systems</strong></a> <div id="panel9" class="content"> Data-driven, adaptive computations are key to enabling the deployment of accurate and efficient stream mining systems, which invoke suitably configured queries in real-time on streams of input data. Due to the physical separation among data sources and computational resources, it is often necessary to deploy such stream mining systems in a distributed fashion, where local learners have access to disjoint subsets of the data that is to be mined, and forward their intermediate results to an ensemble learner that combines the results from the local learners. In this paper, we develop a design methodology for integrated de- sign, simulation, and implementation of dynamic data-driven adaptive stream mining systems. By systematically integrating considerations associated with local embedded processing, classifier configuration, data-driven adaptation and networked com- munication, our approach allows for effective assessment, prototyping, and implementation of alternative distributed design methods for data-driven, adaptive stream mining systems. We demonstrate our results on a dynamic data-driven application involving patient health care monitoring. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper10.html" title="Read A Design Methodology for Distributed Adaptive Stream Mining Systems"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel10"><span class="iconfont"></span> Wang, Yan, et al › <strong>Tracking human queues using single-point signal monitoring</strong></a> <div id="panel10" class="content"> We investigate using smartphoneWiFi signals to track human queues, which are common in many business areas such as retail stores, airports, and theme parks. Real-time monitoring of such queues would enable a wealth of new applications, such as bottleneck analysis, shift assignments, and dynamic workflow scheduling. We take a minimum infrastructure approach and thus utilize a single monitor placed close to the service area along with transmitting phones. Our strategy extracts unique features embedded in signal traces to infer the critical time points when a person reaches the head of the queue and finishes service, and from these inferences we derive a person’s waiting and service times. We develop two approaches in our system, one is directly feature-driven and the second uses a simple Bayesian network. Extensive experiments conducted both in the laboratory as well as in two public facilities demonstrate that our system is robust to real-world environments. We show that in spite of noisy signal readings, our methods can measure service and waiting times to within a 10 second resolution. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/06/01/edge-paper1.html" title="Read Tracking human queues using single-point signal monitoring"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br /><br /> </div> </dd> </dl> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div> <!-- /.row --> </span> </article> </div><!-- /.medium-8.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="up-to-top" class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="subfooter"> <nav class="row"> <section id="subfooter-left" class="b30 small-12 medium-6 columns"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li>© 2014 Board of Trustees Princeton University | Designed and developed at the Princeton EDGE Lab </li> </ul> </section> <section id="subfooter-right" class="small-12 medium-6 columns social-icons"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-twitter" title="Immer das Neuste von Phlow gibt es auf Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-github" title="Code und mehr..."></a></li> </ul> </section> </nav> </div><!-- /#subfooter --> </footer> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/javascript.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
