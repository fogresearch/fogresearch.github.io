By data outsourcing, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed. To securely introduce an effective third party auditor (TPA), the following two fundamental requirements have to be met: 1) TPA should be able to efficiently audit the cloud data storage without demanding the local copy of data, and introduce no additional on-line burden to the cloud user; 2) The third party auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy. In this paper, we utilize and uniquely combine the public key based homomorphic authenticator with random masking to achieve the privacy-preserving public cloud data auditing system, which meets all above requirements. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multi-user setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/28/paper7.html" title="Read Privacy-preserving public auditing for data storage security in cloud computing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel3"><span class="iconfont"></span> Medaglia, Carlo Maria, and Alexandru Serbanati › <strong>An overview of privacy and security issues in the internet of things</strong></a> <div id="panel3" class="content"> While the general definition of the Internet of Things (IoT) is almost mature, roughly defining it as an information network connecting virtual and physical objects, there is a consistent lack of consensus around technical and regulatory solutions.

With these new computing and communications paradigms arise new data security challenges. Existing data protection mechanisms such as encryption have failed in preventing data theft attacks, especially those perpetrated by an insider to the cloud provider. We propose a different approach for securing data in the cloud using offensive decoy technology. We monitor data access in the cloud and detect abnormal data access patterns. When unauthorized access is suspected and then verified using challenge questions, we launch a disinformation attack by returning large amounts of decoy information to the attacker. This protects against the misuse of the user&#39;s real data. Experiments conducted in a local file setting provide evidence that this approach may provide unprecedented levels of user data security in a Cloud environment. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/28/paper4.html" title="Read Fog computing: Mitigating insider data theft attacks in the cloud"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel6"><span class="iconfont"></span> Madsen, Henrik, et al › <strong>Reliability in the utility computing era: Towards reliable Fog computing</strong></a> <div id="panel6" class="content"> This paper considers current paradigms in computing and outlines the most important aspects concerning their reliability.

However, today’s geosocial applications raise privacy concerns due to application providers storing large amounts of information about users (e.g., profile information) and locations (e.g., users present at a location). We propose Zerosquare, a privacy-friendly location hub that encourages the development of privacy-preserving geosocial applications. Our primary goal is to store information such that no entity can link a user’s identity to her location. Other goals include decoupling storing data from manipulating data for social networking purposes, designing an architecture flexible enough to support a wide range of use cases, and limiting client-side computation. Zerosquare consists of two separate server components for storing information about users and about locations, respectively, and optional cloud components for supporting applications. We describe the design of the API exposed by the server components and demonstrate how it can be used to build several sample geosocial applications. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation using Python for the server components and the Android platform for the mobile devices and build several realworld geosocial applications on top of Zerosquare. Finally, we present experimental results that demonstrate the practicality of Zerosquare. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/28/paper1.html" title="Read Zerosquare: A privacy-friendly location hub for geosocial applications"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel9"><span class="iconfont"></span> Mung Chiang › <strong>Fog Networks</strong></a> <div id="panel9" class="content"> What is a FOG Network?: A network architecture that uses one or a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of storage (rather than stored primarily in cloud data centers), communication (rather than routed over backbone networks), and control, configuration, measurement and management (rather than controlled primarily by network gateways such as those in LTE core). <a href="http://localhost:4000/whitepaper/2015/05/27/whitepaper3.html" title="Read Fog Networks"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel10"><span class="iconfont"></span> Michael Enescu › <strong>From Cloud to Fog and The Internet of Things</strong></a> <div id="panel10" class="content"> The Internet of Things arrived last decade when the number of devices (that can connect) outnumbered the world population.

We experimentally show that mobile data mining provides an efficient and scalable approach for data collection for mobile crowdsensing. Our approach results in reducing the amount of data sent, as well as the energy usage on the mobile phone, while providing comparable levels of accuracy to traditional models of intermittent/continuous sensing and sending. We have implemented our Context-Aware Real-time Open Mobile Miner (CAROMM) to facilitate data collection from mobile users for crowdsensing applications. CAROMM also collects and correlates this real-time sensory information with social media data from both Twitter and Facebook.

However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for sitespecific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee -- a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user&#39;s initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length,(c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of ocalization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence.

This, in turn, calls for scheduling the background communication so as to maximize the throughput. It has been recognized in prior work that a key determinant of throughput is the wireless link quality. However, as we show here, another key factor is the load in the cell, arising from the communication of other nodes. Unlike link quality, the only way, thus far, for a cellular client to obtain a measure of load has been to perform active probing, which defeats the goal of minimizing the active duration of the radio. In this paper, we address the above dilemma by making the following contributions. First, we show experimentally that to obtain good throughput, considering link quality alone is insufficient, and that cellular load must also be factored in. Second, we present a novel technique called LoadSense for a cellular client to obtain a measure of the cellular load, locally and passively, that allows the client to determine the ideal times for communication when available throughput to the client is likely to be high. Finally, we present the Peek-n-Sneak protocol, which enables a cellular client to &#39;peek&#39; into the channel and &#39;sneak&#39; in with its background communication when the conditions are suitable. When multiple clients in a cell perform Peen-n-Sneak, it enables them to coordinate their communications, implicitly and in an entirely distributed manner, akin to CSMA in wireless LANs, helping improve throughput (and reduce energy drain) for all. Our experimental evaluation shows overall device energy savings of 20-60% even when Peek-n-Sneak is deployed incrementally <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper3.html" title="Read Coordinating cellular background transfers using loadsense"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel19"><span class="iconfont"></span> Aryafar, Ehsan, et al › <strong>RAT selection games in HetNets</strong></a> <div id="panel19" class="content"> We study the dynamics of network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets).

We propose two general classes of throughput models that capture the basic properties of random access (e.g., Wi-Fi) and scheduled access (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, 3G) networks. Next, we formulate the problem as a non-cooperative game, and study its convergence, efficiency, and practicality. Our results reveal that: (i) Singleclass RAT selection games converge to Nash equilibria, while an improvement path can be repeated infinitely with a mixture of classes. We next introduce a hysteresis mechanism in RAT selection games, and prove that with appropriate hysteresis policies, convergence can still be guaranteed; (ii) We analyze the Pareto-efficiency of the Nash equilibria of these games. We derive the conditions under which Nash equilibria are Paretooptimal, and we quantify the distance of Nash equilibria with respect to the set of Pareto-dominant points when the conditions are not satisfied; (iii) Finally, with extensive measurement-driven simulations we show that RAT selection games converge to Nash equilibria in a small number of steps, and hence are amenable to practical implementation.

However, the typical user may not use all of this network data. When a user is on a limited or pay-per-byte cellular data plan, such as when roaming internationally, this prefetching behavior can cost her in overage fees on her cellular bill. This video demonstrates Procrastinator, which is a system that automatically decides when to fetch each network object that an app requests. This decision is made based on whether the user is on Wi-Fi or cellular, how many bytes are remaining on her data plan, and whether the object is needed at the present time. Procrastinator does not require app developer effort, nor app source code, nor OS changes -- it modifies the app binary to trap specific system calls and inject custom code. Our system can achieve as little as no savings to 4X reduction in total bytes transferred by an app, depending on the user and the app. These savings for the data-poor user come with a 300ms median latency penalty on LTE if the user goes to a part of the app where Procrastinator did not allow data to be prefetched. This video shows how main content on the primary page of apps is unaffected, and the delay that the user will typically experience if she goes to secondary pages in apps when she is running out of cellular data plan bytes.. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper2.html" title="Read Procrastinator: Pacing Mobile Apps’ Usage of the Network."><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel22"><span class="iconfont"></span> Lane, Nicholas D., et al › <strong>A survey of mobile phone sensing </strong></a> <div id="panel22" class="content"> Mobile phones or smartphones are rapidly becoming the central computer and communication device in people&#39;s lives.

We discuss the emerging sensing paradigms, and formulate an architectural framework for discussing a number of the open issues and challenges emerging in the new area of mobile phone sensing research. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper14.html" title="Read A survey of mobile phone sensing "><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel23"><span class="iconfont"></span> Miluzzo, Emiliano, et al › <strong>Darwin phones: the evolution of sensing and inference on mobile phones</strong></a> <div id="panel23" class="content"> We present Darwin, an enabling technology for mobile phone sensing that combines collaborative sensing and classification techniques to reason about human behavior and context on mobile phones. Darwin advances mobile phone sensing through the deployment of efficient but sophisticated machine learning techniques specifically designed to run directly on sensor-enabled mobile phones (i.e., smartphones). Darwin tackles three key sensing and inference challenges that are barriers to mass-scale adoption of mobile phone sensing applications: (i) the human-burden of training classifiers, (ii) the ability to perform reliably in different environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor) and (iii) the ability to scale to a large number of phones without jeopardizing the &#39;phone experience&#39; (e.g., usability and battery lifetime). Darwin is a collaborative reasoning framework built on three concepts: classifier/model evolution, model pooling, and collaborative inference. To the best of our knowledge Darwin is the first system that applies distributed machine learning techniques and collaborative inference concepts to mobile phones. We implement the Darwin system on the Nokia N97 and Apple iPhone. While Darwin represents a general framework applicable to a wide variety of emerging mobile sensing applications, we implement a speaker recognition application and an augmented reality application to evaluate the benefits of Darwin. We show experimental results from eight individuals carrying Nokia N97s and demonstrate that Darwin improves the reliability and scalability of the proof-of-concept speaker recognition application without additional burden to users. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper13.html" title="Read Darwin phones: the evolution of sensing and inference on mobile phones"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel24"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ganti, Raghu K., Fan Ye, and Hui Lei › <strong>Mobile crowdsensing: current state and future challenges</strong></a> <div id="panel24" class="content"> An emerging category of devices at the edge of the Internet are consumer-centric mobile sensing and computing devices, such as smartphones, music players, and in-vehicle sensors. These devices will fuel the evolution of the Internet of Things as they feed sensor data to the Internet at a societal scale. In this article, we examine a category of applications that we term mobile crowdsensing, where individuals with sensing and computing devices collectively share data and extract information to measure and map phenomena of common interest. We present a brief overview of existing mobile crowdsensing applications, explain their unique characteristics, illustrate various research challenges, and discuss possible solutions. Finally, we argue the need for a unified architecture and envision the requirements it must satisfy. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper12.html" title="Read Mobile crowdsensing: current state and future challenges"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel25"><span class="iconfont"></span> Rula, John, and Fabián E. Bustamant › <strong>Crowd (soft) control: moving beyond the opportunistic</strong></a> <div id="panel25" class="content"> A number of novel wireless networked services, ranging from participatory sensing to social networking, leverage the increasing capabilities of mobile devices and the movements of the individuals carrying them. For many of these systems, their effectiveness fundamentally depends on coverage and the particular mobility patterns of the participants. Given the strong spatial and temporal regularity of human mobility, the needed coverage can typically only be attained through a large participant base. In this paper we explore an alternative approach to attain coverage without scale -- (soft) controlling the movement of participants. We present Crowd Soft Control (CSC), an approach to exert limited control over the temporal and spatial movements of mobile users by leveraging the built-in incentives of location-based gaming and social applications. By pairing network services with these location-based apps, CSC allows researchers to use an application&#39;s incentives (e.g. game objectives) to control the movement of participating users, increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the associated network service. After outlining the case for Crowd Soft Control, we present an initial prototype of our ideas and discuss potential benefits and costs in the context of two case studies. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper11.html" title="Read Crowd (soft) control: moving beyond the opportunistic"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel26"><span class="iconfont"></span> Chon, Yohan, et al › <strong>Automatically characterizing places with opportunistic crowdsensing using smartphones.</strong></a> <div id="panel26" class="content"> Automated and scalable approaches for understanding the semantics of places are critical to improving both existing and emerging mobile services. In this paper, we present CrowdSense@Place (CSP), a framework that exploits a previously untapped resource -- opportunistically captured images and audio clips from smartphones -- to link place visits with place categories (e.g., store, restaurant). CSP combines signals based on location and user trajectories (using WiFi/GPS) along with various visual and audio place &#39;hints&#39; mined from opportunistic sensor data. Place hints include words spoken by people, text written on signs or objects recognized in the environment. We evaluate CSP with a seven-week, 36-user experiment involving 1,241 places in five locations around the world. Our results show that CSP can classify places into a variety of categories with an overall accuracy of 69%, outperforming currently available alternative solutions. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper10.html" title="Read Automatically characterizing places with opportunistic crowdsensing using smartphones."><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel27"><span class="iconfont"></span> Rula, John P., et al. ACM, 2014 › <strong>No one-size fits all: towards a principled approach for incentives in mobile crowdsourcing</strong></a> <div id="panel27" class="content"> We are becoming increasingly aware that the effectiveness of mobile crowdsourcing systems critically depends on the whims of their human participants, impacting everything from participant engagement to their compliance with the crowdsourced tasks. In response, a number of such systems have started to incorporate different incentive features aimed at a wide range of goals that span from improving participation levels, to extending the systems&#39; coverage, and enhancing the quality of the collected data. Despite the many related efforts, the inclusion of incentives in crowdsourced systems has so far been mostly ad-hoc, treating incentives as a wild-card response fitted for any occasion and goal. Using data from a large, 2-day experiment with 96 participants at a corporate conference, we present an analysis of the impact of two incentive structures on the recruitment, compliance and user effort of a basic mobile crowdsourced service. We build on these preliminary results to argue for a principled approach for selecting incentive and incentive structures to match the variety of requirements of mobile crowdsourcing applications and discuss key issues in working toward that goal. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper1.html" title="Read No one-size fits all: towards a principled approach for incentives in mobile crowdsourcing"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel28"><span class="iconfont"></span> Ravindranath, Lenin, et al › <strong>Video: Procrastinator: pacing mobile apps' usage of the network</strong></a> <div id="panel28" class="content"> There are two emerging trends in the mobile data world. First, mobile data is exploding at a rapid rate with analysts predicting 25-50X growth by the year 2015. The second trend is that users are demanding greater degree of flexibility in selecting their operators at fine timescales. Across Asia, dual-SIM phones have become popular, while Apple is rumored to be designing a Universal SIM that will allow iPhone users to toggle between different operators. This latter trend points towards an impending disruption in wireless service models which could also be the need of the hour from the spectrum shortage perspective. This points towards a new service model where users can choose an operator based on application needs. However, if users make this choice greedily without network assistance, it can exacerbate spectrum scarcity and degrade user experience. In this work, we consider user devices with multiple network interfaces (3G, LTE etc.) that can be simultaneously active and each running multiple applications. We propose the MOTA service model to enable users to associate each interface with the operator of choice at fine time scales. Under the MOTA service model, through concise signalling information, operators provide information about their own network, so that each user can (i) choose a suitable operator for each interface, and (ii) choose an interface for each active application. We make the following contributions in this paper. First, we propose concise network signalling that assists users to make informed choices even under mobility. Second, we develop user-choice algorithms that maximize a suitable notion of user satisfaction while using spectrum resources efficiently. Third, we perform extensive evaluation over actual base station deployment in a city coupled with real signal propagation maps. Our results with two operators show that, MOTA service model provides capacity gain in the range 2.5-4X over the current existing service model. Finally, we argue that our solution is practically implementable by combining appropriate IEEE standards and IETF proposals. <a href="http://localhost:4000/researchpaper/2015/05/27/paper1.html" title="Read Video: Procrastinator: pacing mobile apps' usage of the network"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> <dd class="accordion-navigation"> <a href="#panel29"><span class="iconfont"></span> Education › <strong>First MOOC on FOG</strong></a> <div id="panel29" class="content"> Fog Networks and the Internet of Things <a href="http://localhost:4000/news/2015/03/10/FOGCourse.html" title="Read First MOOC on FOG"><strong>Read More&nbsp;›</strong></a><br><br> </div> </dd> </dl> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="up-to-top" class="row"> <div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page">&#xf108;</a> </div><!-- /.small-12.columns --> </div><!-- /.row --> <div id="subfooter"> <nav class="row"> <section id="subfooter-left" class="b30 small-12 medium-6 columns"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li>© 2014 Board of Trustees Princeton University | Designed and developed at the Princeton EDGE Lab </li> </ul> </section> <section id="subfooter-right" class="small-12 medium-6 columns social-icons"> <ul class="inline-list"> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-twitter" title="Immer das Neuste von Phlow gibt es auf Twitter"></a></li> <li><a href="http://github.com/fogresearch" target="_blank" class="icon-github" title="Code und mehr..."></a></li> </ul> </section> </nav> </div><!-- /#subfooter --> </footer> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/javascript.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
