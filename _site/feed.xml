        <title>Fog Computing: Bringing Cloud Capabilities Down to Earth</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When we think of “cloud” we think of a vast collection of compute, network, and storage capabilities that resides somewhere high above us—a massive repository of functionality that can be accessed from anywhere and any device with enough bandwidth to handle the data flow.
With practically unlimited power and scalability, cloud technology has been a key enabler of the Internet. But the Internet of Things (IoT) demands something more. IoT is a broad collection of sensors, cameras, smartphones, computers, and machines—all connected to and communicating with applications, websites, social media, and other devices. To maximize value, much of the data generated by these “things” must be processed and analyzed in real time. For example, sensors and cameras in and around a large retail store may continuously collect data about customer volume and traffic flow. The store can derive some value from all this data by sending it back to the cloud to analyze long-term trends. But the value is multiplied if the system can process the data locally, in real time, and then act on it immediately by sending more cashiers to the check-out line just before a surge in customer traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>McKinsey report on IoT: The Internet of Things: Mapping the Value Beyond the Hype</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things—sensors and actuators connected by networks to computing systems—has received enormous attention over the past five years. A new McKinsey Global Institute report, The Internet of Things: Mapping the value beyond the hype, attempts to determine exactly how IoT technology can create real economic value.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analytics Evolving to the Edge, Leading Data to Reach 1.6 Zettabytes by 2020, Study Says</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By the end of the decade, says a recent study by ABI research called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1021642-edge-analytics-in-iot/&quot;&gt;Edge Analytics in IoT&lt;/a&gt;,” M2M and other IoT-enabled devices will likely have collected more than 1.6 zettabytes (1.6 trillion GB) of data. As a point of caparison, the entire internet was has been estimated to be at somewhere between 4 and 7 trillion GB of data right now. &lt;br /&gt;
“The data originating from connected products and processes follows a certain journey of magnitudes. The yearly volumes that are generated within endpoints are counted in yottabytes, but only a tiny fraction of this vast data mass is actually being captured for storage or further analysis,” said Aapo Markkanen, principal analyst at ABI. “&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Verizon releases The Internet of Things 2015 report</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With billions of devices autonomously pushing data up into the cloud and receiving instructions in return, there will be much greater reliance on networks, even though most IoT traffic will be low volume and in short bursts. Work is already underway to develop intelligent devices that process, filter, and analyze data right at the edge of the network, so decisions can be quickly made.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FOG Networking for 5G and IoT</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pushing computation, control and storage into the “cloud” has been a key trend in networking in the past decade. Over-dependence on the cloud, however, indicates that availability and fault tolerance issues in the cloud would directly impact millions of end-users. Indeed, the cloud is now “descending” to the network edge and often diffused among the client devices in both mobile and wireline networks. The cloud is becoming the “fog.” Empowered by the latest chips, radios, and sensors, each client device today is powerful in computation, in storage, in sensing and in communication. Yet client devices are still limited in battery power, global view of the network, and mobility support. Most interestingly, the collection of many clients in a crowd presents a highly distributed, under-organized, and possibly dense network. Further, wireless networks is increasingly used locally, e.g. intra-building, intra-vehicle, and personal body-area networks; and data generated locally is increasingly consumed locally.
Fog Network presents an architecture that uses one or a collaborative multitude of end-user clients or near-user edge devices to carry out storage, communication, computation, and control in a network. It is an architecture that will support the Internet of Things, heterogeneous 5G mobile services, and home and personal area networks. Fog Networking leverages past experience in sensor networks, P2P and MANET research, and incorporates the latest advances in devices, network systems, and data science to reshape the “balance of power” in the ecosystem of computing and networking.&lt;/p&gt;
