title: "Eywa: Crowdsourced and cloudsourced omniscience"
teaser: "Here we present our ubiquitous computing vision, Eywa. Eywa is an open publish-subscribe system that employs crowdsourcing for tasking and social networks & machine learning for identifying relevance. We argue that crowdsourcing (and the social networks and machine learning that enable it) should be a first class citizen in ubiquitous computing. We also observe that cloud computing is a natural platform to host such future ubiquitous computing systems. We discuss about some applications enabled by Eywa, and focus on our CuratedLiving application (which emphasizes “less choice more relevance” approach) as a case study."
