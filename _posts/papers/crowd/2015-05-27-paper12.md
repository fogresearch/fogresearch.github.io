title: "Mobile crowdsensing: current state and future challenges"
teaser:  "An emerging category of devices at the edge of the Internet are consumer-centric mobile sensing and computing devices, such as smartphones, music players, and in-vehicle sensors. These devices will fuel the evolution of the Internet of Things as they feed sensor data to the Internet at a societal scale. In this article, we examine a category of applications that we term mobile crowdsensing, where individuals with sensing and computing devices collectively share data and extract information to measure and map phenomena of common interest. We present a brief overview of existing mobile crowdsensing applications, explain their unique characteristics, illustrate various research challenges, and discuss possible solutions. Finally, we argue the need for a unified architecture and envision the requirements it must satisfy."
