title: "Lowering the barriers to large-scale mobile crowdsensing"
teaser: "Mobile crowdsensing is becoming a vital technique for environment monitoring, infrastructure management, and social computing. However, deploying mobile crowdsensing applications in large-scale environments is not a trivial task. It creates a tremendous burden on application developers as well as mobile users. In this paper we try to reveal the barriers hampering the scale-up of mobile crowdsensing applications, and to offer our initial thoughts on the potential solutions to lowering the barriers."
