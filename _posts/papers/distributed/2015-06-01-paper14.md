title: "Pocketsphinx: A free, real-time continuous speech recognition system for hand-held devices"
teaser: "The availability of real-time continuous speech recognition on mobile and embedded devices has opened up a wide range of research opportunities in human-computer interactive applications. Unfortunately, most of the work in this area to date has been confined to proprietary software, or has focused on limited domains with constrained grammars. In this paper, we present a preliminary case study on the porting and optimization of CMU Sphinx-11, a popular open source large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system, to hand-held devices. The resulting system operates in an average 0.87 times real-time on a 206 MHz device, 8.03 times faster than the baseline system. To our knowledge, this is the first hand-held LVCSR system available under an open-source license"
