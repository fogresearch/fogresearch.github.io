title: "An overview of privacy and security issues in the internet of things"
teaser: "While the general definition of the Internet of Things (IoT) is almost mature, roughly defining it as an information network connecting virtual and physical objects, there is a consistent lack of consensus around technical and regulatory solutions. There is no doubt, though, that the new paradigm will bring forward a completely new host of issues because of its deep impact on all aspects of human life. In this work, the authors outline the current technological and technical trends and their impacts on the security, privacy, and governance. The work is split into short- and long-term analysis where the former is focused on already or soon available technology, while the latter is based on vision concepts. Also, an overview of the vision of the European Commission on this topic will be provided."
