title: "Finding your Way in the Fog: Towards a Comprehensive Definition of Fog Computing"
teaser: "The cloud is migrating to the edge of the network, where routers themselves may become the virtualisation infrastruc- ture, in an evolution labelled as “the fog”. However, many other complementary technologies are reaching a high level of maturity. Their interplay may dramatically shift the in- formation and communication technology landscape in the following years, bringing separate technologies into a com- mon ground. This paper offers a comprehensive definition of the fog, comprehending technologies as diverse as cloud, sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks, network virtualisa- tion functions or configuration management techniques. We highlight the main challenges faced by this potentially break- through technology amalgamation."
