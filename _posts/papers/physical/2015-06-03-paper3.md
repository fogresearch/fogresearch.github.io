title: "Game theoretic modeling of cooperation among service providers in mobile cloud computing environments"
teaser: "Mobile cloud computing aims at improving the performance of mobile applications and to enhance the resource utilization of service providers. In this paper, we consider a mobile cloud computing environment in which the service providers can form a coalition to create a resource pool to support the mobile applications. First, an admission control mechanism is used to provide services of mobile applications to the users given the available long-term reserved resources in a pool. An optimization formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal decision of admission control. Then, for a given coalition of service providers, the revenue obtained from utilizing the resource pool has to be shared among the service providers. A coalitional game model is developed for sharing the revenue. In addition, since the service providers can decide on short-term capacity expansion of the resource pool, a game model is introduced to obtain the optimal strategies of service providers on capacity expansion such that their profits are maximized."
