title: "Finding it now: Construction and configuration of networked classifiers in real-time stream mining systems"
teaser: "As data is becoming more and more prolific and complex, the ability to process it and extract valuable information has become a critical requirement. However, performing such signal processing tasks requires to solve multiple challenges. Indeed, information must frequently be extracted (a) from many distinct data streams, (b) using limited resources, and (c) in real time to be of value. The aim of this chapter is to describe and optimize the specifications of signal processing systems, aimed at extracting in real time valuable information out of large-scale decentralized datasets. A first section will explain the motivations and stakes which have made stream mining a new and emerging field of research and describe key characteristics and challenges of stream mining applications. We then formalize an analytical framework which will be used to describe and optimize distributed stream mining knowledge extraction from large scale streams. In stream mining applications, classifiers are organized into a connected topology mapped onto a distributed infrastructure. We will study linear chains of classifiers and determine how the ordering of the classifiers in the chain impacts accuracy of classification and delay and determine how to choose the most suitable order of classifiers. Finally, we present a decentralized decision framework upon which distributed algorithms for joint topology construction and local classifier configuration can be constructed. Stream mining is an active field of research, at the crossing of various disciplines, including multimedia signal processing, distributed systems, machine learning etc. As such, we will indicate several areas for future research and development."
