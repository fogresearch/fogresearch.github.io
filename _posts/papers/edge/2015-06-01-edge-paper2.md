title: "Edge Cloud and Underlay Networks: Empowering 5G Cell-Less Wireless Architecture"
teaser: "The 5th generation wireless communication networks are expected to face the challenge of providing satisfactory - in terms of user experience - connections to ten or even hundred times more connected devices than today. To meet such challenge, a revolutionary change in the network architecture is required. In this paper, we discuss potential directions for the future wireless network architecture and key techniques. An edge cloud and underlay network architecture is proposed by leveraging techniques such as network virtualization, edge computing, local traffic offloading, cloudbased control and processing for improving the overall network efficiency and user experience. This technology advance forms the foundation of the next generation wireless network architecture. Case studies on key enabling techniques of the proposed edge cloud and underlay network architecture are presented together with preliminary design concepts and numerical results."
