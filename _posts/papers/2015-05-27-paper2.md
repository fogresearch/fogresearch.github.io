title: "Multitiered inference management architecture for participatory sensing"
teaser: "This paper describes a multitiered architecture for realizing an inference management firewall (IMF) that employs context-aware information masking techniques for systematic management of risk-vs-value trade-off of sensor data. Previously we have demonstrated an initial implementation of the IMF running as messaging services on the Information Fabric, which is a middleware asset developed under the International Technology Alliance (ITA) research program. Furthermore, we have presented an additional asset, recently implemented on a commercially-available mobile device running the Android operating system, which is intended to operate as an information source and first-line inference management capability at the edge of the network. The low-cost and widespread use of Android-based mobile devices offers a popular platform for crowdsourced participatory sensing. The focus of our current work is on the integration of these two technology assets in support of policy-managed, sensor-driven workflows in coalition scenarios."
